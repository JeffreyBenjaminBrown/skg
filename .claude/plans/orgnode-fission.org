* Jeff's vague spec
** Status and motivation
   Currently the OrgNode type uses the TrueNode type,
   which has optional 'id' and 'source' fields.
   That's handy when initially ingesting an orgnode.
   But once we've passed the validation stage,
   it's awkward to continually be pattern-matching
   on whether the ID or Source exists.
** Goal
   In the save-buffer execution path, everything after
     find_buffer_errors_for_saving
   should use a new 'checked' variety of OrgNode.
   In the new-buffer execution path,
     *everything* should use the checked variety.
** Details
   The checked orgnode variety will be the default,
   so we'll call it OrgNode.
   Similarly with the checked variety of TrueNode.
   So modify those types where they are currently defined
   (server/types/orgnode.rs) so that ID and Source are mandatory.

   Introduce a parallel file called 'unchecked_orgnode.rs',
   that defines types 'UncheckedOrgNode' and 'UncheckedTrueNode'.
   'UncheckedOrgNode' will use the same Scaffold defined in orgnode.rs.

   Then perform the replacement described above in 'Goal'.
