Skg is for thinkers, students and writers. It is an open-source app for writing, collecting (from elsewhere), organizing and sharing information. (Any of which can be ignored -- you don't have to share, for instance, or even write, in order to benefit from it.)

In a world of abundant information, Skg lets users direct their attention, process information and collaborate more effectively.
