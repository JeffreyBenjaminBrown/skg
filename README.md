# USAGE

## If you've already got Rust and TypeDB

Start the typedb server
(by typing just that: `typedb server`).

In a separate shell, run `cargo run`.

## To run it in a tailor-made Docker container

Find that container at https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/docker-typedb-rust and build it.

Start it (using something like the
`docker run` command in `docker.sh`).

Enter it (using something like the
`docker exec` command in `docker.sh`).

Run `cd` to go to the home folder (`/home/ubuntu`).

Then go to "If you've already got Rust and TypeDB" above.
