Skg is for thinkers, students and writers. It is an open-source app for writing, collecting (from elsewhere), organizing and sharing information. (Any of which can be ignored -- you don't have to share, for instance, or even write, in order to benefit from it.) In a world of abundant information, Skg would let users direct their attention, process information and collaborate more effectively.

If you're a programmer, I'd love some help. [[Skg is built on cool technologies.](docs/cool-tech-in-skg.md)]
