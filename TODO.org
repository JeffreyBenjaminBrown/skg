* Why do I see nothing printed by index_titles::update_index when I run the tests?
* DONE ? TypeDB must know about links
  in both title and *body*
** in Rust
*** create a type for links
    with ID and link text
*** create a new SkgNode field, "link_targets"
*** parse links in text and body
** in TypeDB, create a new relation, "links"
   links (from: node, to: node)
* Export from TypeDB to files?
* persist TypeDB data
  consider too how Tantivy data is persisted
* constraints
** test each constraint of the schema
   Some violations might not be representable in the .skg format.
** Can a file include multiple comments_on properties?
   It shouldn't.
** `contains` should be acyclic
   The TypeDB AI says I can use `distinct` instead,
   but the docs on `distinct` don't suggest that's true.
* optimizations
** unify Tantivy and TypeDB indexation
** If `titles` were the first field in the .skg format
   then the Tantivy indexing would need to read less
