** ask AI to research and present options before implementing
*** Clear its context before doing that.
*** Includes even asking for refactoring plan.
*** why : helps me
*** why : helps the AI
    Loads up its context with good stuff,
    for when it finally implements the chosen path.
** cargo nextest run
** cargo test --doc
   runs 'doctests', which ensure code in documentation works.
** claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   Less ergonomically, can say:
   "Don't do anything you don't have permission to do.
   I'm going to be away so I can't grant it."
* QA
** Appending from indef nodes moght be a misfeature.
** completeContents seems too long
** RelToParent could be generalized as RelToAncestor.
   It would need both a relation and a number of levels.
   (RelToParent would translate to 1 level; to grandparent, 2; etc.)
** nah
*** 'merge' should be encodeable in NodeSaveAction
    Then I wouldn't need to parse the action twice,
    in two different ways.
** test validate_merge_requests
** in elisp/skg-sexpr/skg-lens.el, rather than concatenate with ":"
   (that's done by skg--tokens->string)

   Instead of returning a :-separated string,
   return a list of lists of propertized strings,
   which the calling function can decide how to concatenate.
** Indefinitive nodes skip the visited-checking logic
   when saving a buffer.
   This is not clearly a problem.
** Maybe indefinitive nodes and repeated nodes should be merged.
** these integration tests could be merged

*** mk_orgnode from save/buffer_to_orgnodes/uninterpreted.rs
    does something already done in mk_org_text/
*** Buffer_Cannot_Be_Saved and SaveError
** use the tests at not_using/pids_from_ids/tests.rs
** test the propagation of Buffer_Cannot_Be_Saved errors
   in commit 130318842f5ad0ad92279d14f85d8b950e6f844a,
   I started using
     find_buffer_errors_for_saving,
   which covers more cases than what I had been using,
     find_inconsistent_instructions
   But the tests only cover what
     find_inconsistent_instructions
   might return.

* document
** that filenames must correspond to PIDs
** the dangers of repeated nodes to the user
   The original data model was that each node would have only one container. That proved infeasible, because the user can copy data at will. So skg accepts such data. But bear in mind that it is dangerous. The danger is this: If a node has branches, and is copied somewhere earlier in the same document, then that new copy will take precedence. Edits to it will be treated as *the* edits. If all you did was copy the node but not its branches, its branches will be lost when you save.
** find where to put this comment
 // Titles can include textlinks,
 // but can be searched for as if each textlink
 // was equal to its label, thanks to replace_each_link_with_its_label.
** change graph -> web
** drop [[../docs/progress.md][progress.md]]
** Didactically, concept maps > knowledge graph.
** [[../docs/data-model.md][The data model]] and [[../docs/sharing-model.md][The sharing model]] overlap
   as documents.
** "point" seems a better name than "node"
   But it conflicts with the Emacs 'point'.
