   Do this instead of

   Would require rewriting a lot of code to take an orgnode forest and an id-skgnode map instead of PairTrees.
   Seems morally better: Two SkgNodes in a PairTree for the same ID could theoretically diverge, and even if they don't, the duplication wastes space.
   But access patterns would probably get uglier.

*** NOTE: Body validation on Scaffolds
    Body_of_AliasCol and Body_of_Alias errors are no longer detectable

    These validations should happen during parsing if needed.

*** After 'view_requests_at_node', is there any reason to keep the view requests in the node?
    The function pushes the node's requests onto 'view_requests_out'.
    If they should be deleted from the node thereafter,
    the function should be renamed something like 'transfer_requests'.
*** On what Interps can 'completeAndReorder_childrenOf_definitiveOrgnode' be validly called?
    The comment says only nodes with Interp = Content.
    If that's right (I think so) the name should reflect it.

**** in this function

     Don't call makeIndefinitiveAndClobber in

     Instead do it only in clobberIndefinitiveOrgnode.
     And in clobberIndefinitiveOrgnode, call makeIndefinitiveAndClobber,
     instead of essentially restating its definition.
*** maybe_add_hiddenInSubscribeeCol_branch should integrate

*** ? ignorable
**** what if 'ensure_skgnode' is omitted?
***** omitted from complete_or_restore_each_node_in_branch
***** elaboration
      It seems like an absent skgnode where ensure_skgnode is called
      might be an unreachable state.
** AWAITS sharing
*** AWAITS subscription branches
**** PITFALL: Hiding is not ternary.
     SubscribeR node R Hides node H from *all* its subscriptions.
     When the nodes R hides are *displayed*,
       they can be grouped by their parents,
       and orphaned hidden nodes can be grouped separately,
     but in the graph they are not represented that way.
**** DONE Just like locally-owned nodes, make a Subscribee's Content into (the last and probably most of) its top-level children.
**** DONE Collect each subscribee's hidden in a HiddenCol midparent.
     The HiddenCol midparent is indefinitive.
     Its contents can be modified, and it can be deleted entirely,
     to no effect.
     Its contents respawn from disk on each save.
       (The user should perhaps be warned if that happens.)
**** DONE to populate Content and Hidden in a subscription branch, filter each subscribee's Contents into
****** Hidden = intersects with what the subscriber hides
****** Content = intersects not
**** DONE Collect hidden nodes that belong to no subscribee separately.
     in a midparent titled 'hidden outside of subscribees'.
     This one is also indefinite, respawning on each save.
**** Saving can change a subscription's contents in two ways.
***** via deletion
      Deleting a top-level node adds it to 'hidden'.
***** via insertion
****** Only something from 'hidden' can be inserted.
       This un-hides it.
****** Order does not matter.
       When saving,
       the subscribee branch'scontents are treated as a set,
       and intersected with the set of contents of the
         (foreign) subscribee.
**** When the user edits a subscribeeCol
     Its children determine what is subscribed to.
     The Contents of its children can be edited to change Hides relationships.
     The rest of the SubscribeeCol branch are respawned on save,
       and have no effect if edited before saving.
*** extend saving for sharing relations
**** In saveinstructions_from_tree, recurse into subscribees
***** change this passage in saveinstructions_from_tree

        return Ok(()); } // Skip - these don't generate SaveInstructions
***** how to treat Subscribees
   If indefinitive, visit descendents but otherwise ignore.
   If definitive, treat its content list as a set,
     and hide in the subscriber anything not included.
***** how to treat foreign content
   Compare content to what's on disk.
   If there's a discrepancy, override and subscribe.
*** extend complete_or_restore_each_node_in_branch
    to complete a SubscribeeCol, and within one
    to handle Subscribees
** What does the SkgNode in a PairTree represent?
   If it's written by ensure_skgnode, it's from disk.
   But sometimes it's generated from the org tree.
   If this varies it should be encoded in the type --
   maybe with a boolean 'complete' flag,
   or a product of bools 'completionState'
   with, maybe, fields like
     id_present
     can_be_saved_this_way
     was_completed

       negative i signify descendents.

         "ni" is the alternative way to start.
         There is no reason to start or end with "..".

** the dangers of repeated nodes to the user
   The original data model was that each node would have only one container. That proved infeasible, because the user can copy data at will. So skg accepts such data. But bear in mind that it is dangerous. The danger is this: If a node has branches, and is copied somewhere earlier in the same document, then that new copy will take precedence. Edits to it will be treated as *the* edits. If all you did was copy the node but not its branches, its branches will be lost when you save.
