* Move 'clobberIndefinitiveOrgnode' to neighor file 'util.rs'
* Should 'merge_nodes' be in 'update_graph'?
* Why can't I use 'M-.' to find 'merge_nodes_in_typedb'?
** and what does 'super' mean in its definition?
* Is it natural that skg-request-save-buffer issues so many distinct calls to process-send-string?
* undoing that mis-feature shouldn't be hard
  Don't let indefinite nodes contribute at all to saving,
  but recognize that their children might.

* QA
** add tests
*** collect_generation_ids
    test the new effective root logic
** This seems like it could have been more efficient.
   rust/to_org/definitive_branch.rs
   sharing more code with
   rust/to_org/initial_view_bfs.rs
** Appending from indef nodes moght be a misfeature.
** completeContents seems too long
** RelToParent could be generalized as RelToAncestor.
   It would need both a relation and a number of levels.
   (RelToParent would translate to 1 level; to grandparent, 2; etc.)
** nah
*** 'merge' should be encodeable in NodeSaveAction
    Then I wouldn't need to parse the action twice,
    in two different ways.
** test validate_merge_requests
** in elisp/skg-sexpr/skg-lens.el, rather than concatenate with ":"
   (that's done by skg--tokens->string)

   Instead of returning a :-separated string,
   return a list of lists of propertized strings,
   which the calling function can decide how to concatenate.
** Indefinitive nodes skip the visited-checking logic
   when saving a buffer.
   This is not clearly a problem.
** Maybe indefinitive nodes and repeated nodes should be merged.

   But the tests only cover what

   might return.

* document
** that filenames must correspond to PIDs
** the dangers of repeated nodes to the user
   The original data model was that each node would have only one container. That proved infeasible, because the user can copy data at will. So skg accepts such data. But bear in mind that it is dangerous. The danger is this: If a node has branches, and is copied somewhere earlier in the same document, then that new copy will take precedence. Edits to it will be treated as *the* edits. If all you did was copy the node but not its branches, its branches will be lost when you save.
