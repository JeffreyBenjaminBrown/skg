   This guides me,
   and also loads up its context with good stuff,
   for when it finally implements the chosen path.

   This integration test works:
     tests/integration/containerward-view-request/test-emacs.el
   and it's clear.
   But when I run it interactively I get strange results.
** "indefinitive nodes skip the visited-checking logic entirely"
   when saving a buffer.
   This is not clearly a problem.

*** Buffer_Cannot_Be_Saved and SaveError

   in commit 130318842f5ad0ad92279d14f85d8b950e6f844a,
   I started using
     find_buffer_errors_for_saving,
   which covers more cases than what I had been using,
     find_inconsistent_instructions
   But the tests only cover what
     find_inconsistent_instructions
   might return.

* document
** that filenames must correspond to PIDs
** the dangers of repeated nodes to the user
   The original data model was that each node would have only one container. That proved infeasible, because the user can copy data at will. So skg accepts such data. But bear in mind that it is dangerous. The danger is this: If a node has branches, and is copied somewhere earlier in the same document, then that new copy will take precedence. Edits to it will be treated as *the* edits. If all you did was copy the node but not its branches, its branches will be lost when you save.
