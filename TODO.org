(2) Uniqueness in the second (right) position -- that is, if (N contains M) then there can exist no N' distinct from N such that (N' contains M). In TypeDB this can be expressed as "contains sub relation, @acyclic, relates container, relates contained @unique;".
  subscribed to :: Relationship <Node, Node>     # Unconstrained.
  unsubscribed from :: Relationship <Node, Node> # Unconstrained.
* "context" is redundant!
  It is implied by the `contains` relationship,
  assuming `contains` is acyclic.

** If `titles` were the first field in the .skg format
   then the Tantivy indexing would need to read less
