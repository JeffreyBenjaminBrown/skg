* "repeated" bodies
** In Rust, when building the document
   if a node is repeated,
   do not recurse into its children,
   and replace its body with "repeated earlier",
   in system-colored text.
** In Emacs
*** keep the "repeated" property.
*** Permit copying the ID at point, and searching
    for other nodes with that ID in the same document.
** In Rust, when saving a document
   If a node has repeated = t,
   do not use that data to modify it.
