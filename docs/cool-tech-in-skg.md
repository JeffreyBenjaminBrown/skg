# Skg is built on cool technologies.
(That said, I'm flexible -- if you want to write a non-Emacs client, or rewrite the server in Haskell, let's go!)

Skg uses Rust for the server, TypeDB for the DB, and Emacs for the client.

Rust surely needs no introduction, but I want to point out that it's actually not that hard, now that AI understands it.

TypeDB is a stupendously expressive graph database, in which relationships can have any number of members (instead of the usual 2) and can themselves be members of other relationships.

Lisp might be the most venerated language in history. Emacs is written in Lisp, and is basically an interactive Lisp interpreter. It offers the user a degree of control that beggars belief.
