# The traditional knowledge mapping data model: Linked trees

This data model is dirt-simple. Ordinary books with citations use it. So do Wikipedia, most of the rest of the internet, and [a large number of "personal knowledge management" apps](who-maps-knowledge.md).

Each document is a `tree` of text, with `links`. A tree of text is just text that can (optionally!) be divided into sections, subsections, sub-subsections, etc. Links can go from any part of one tree to any part of any other tree.

That's the whole model.
