# How will it do networking?

There's a project called Agora with a model that will work for someone with a few hundred friends. In Agora, everyone maintains a mindmap as a (usually GitHub) repo, and is perpetually polling the repos of everyone they are subscribed to for updates. The polling needn't be frequent, and the data probably won't be large. I've been collecting notes like a madman since around Jan 2020 and my public notes are only 35 Mb.

Since the initial user base will probably be nerds like us, I think that should be user-friendly enough as an initial solution. It won't be hard to script the repo updates to be automatic if a user likes. (They'll still have to manually create a space for their data to reside online. I hope that's not too much of a stumbling block.)

If we run into space constraints that'll be a wonderful problem to have. I haven't thought much about how to solve it. Certainly it's not necessary to download all of every person's public data, given that much of it will probably never cross your eyes.
