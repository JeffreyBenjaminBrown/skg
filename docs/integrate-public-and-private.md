# Integrate your public and private writing.
This only recently became possible! ([Semantic Synchrony](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn) is the first and, to my knowledge, only other app to permit it.)

Public and private writing both matter, but strictly separating your public and private writing is a problem. How many times has that separation kept an author away from an insight they would have found, had their private and public thoughts been in the same document? And how many thoughts that would have benefited the public have been lost because they were part of someone's private writing, even when the author would have been willing to release the idea outside of its private context?

Skg will allow you to organize your public and private thoughts in the same space. This maximizes your notes' utility to yourself and others, while maintaining your privacy.

You can, of course, still choose to make everything private. But sharing enables others to help you process your shared topics -- even if that's not their intent, and even if they disagree completely (see [Learn from how others integrate your notes into theirs](skg-enables-deep-sharing.md#learn-from-how-others-use-your-ideas)).
