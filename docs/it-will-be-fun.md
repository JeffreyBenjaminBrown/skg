# We're trapped in time!
The world of ideas is a web, not a line. Thinking and communicating in long strings of words is a straitjacket -- one we strangely learn to ignore. Skg aims to free us from it, allowing us to share the web of connections in our heads.

# The solution is easy!
Writing essays is hard, and reading them can be tedious if the author guesses wrong about what the reader will want to know when. Webs of thought suffer neither problem.

Recording relationships between ideas -- building the web -- is so easy that you don't even need to use complete sentences. Drawing lines between phrases (e.g. "forgiveness -> freedom", "hope -> ambition", "self-confidence -> spiritual healing", ..) is enough to convey interesting information about how one sees the world. Collecting such relationships, it does not take much time at all to build a web that's fun to navigate (i.e. to think about).

# The challenge is peaceful!
Building a web by recording and connecting thoughts as they come, can resemble meditation, or fishing, but my favorite metaphor is birdwatching. You watch the idea approach, it flitters around, transforms into other ideas, but finally it hovers so close that you are able to put the idea into words. Once it is in words, the bird-idea has become a puzzle piece, to fit into the web at your leisure.

# Find greater wholeness! Shelter your orphan thoughts!
To add an idea to your web of thought is to put it into context, and in the process build those contexts. It is the physical embodiment of the act of understanding.
