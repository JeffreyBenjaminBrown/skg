# Knowledge gardening is Zen.
Knowledge gardening is a process thousands of years old. It can be done with pen and paper, but it's faster on a computer.

Knowledge gardening consists of writing notes, editing them, studying them, and thinking about them. It is not a stream, like conventional social media, but rather a long-term investment. It is the accumulation, organization and ongoing cognitive processing of a body of knowledge.

Knowledge gardening is usually conceived of as reading and writing, but it includes other mental states. I count meditation among them. Each of us is already, in ordinary life, forever traversing the spectrum these states occupy.

Tech can augment how we process information -- witness the written word, the printing press, or the internet. Knowledge gardening apps take another step in that direction, by making it easier yet to organize and process a large body of accumulated information. And Skg would take yet another, by scaling the sharing of information processing.
