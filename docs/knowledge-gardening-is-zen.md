# Knowledge gardening is Zen.
Knowledge gardening is a process thousands of years old. It can be done with pen and paper, but it's faster on a computer.

Knowledge gardening consists of writing notes, editing them, studying them, and thinking about them. It is a long-term investment: the accumulation, organization and ongoing cognitive processing of a body of knowledge.

Knowledge gardening is usually conceived of as reading and writing, but it includes other mental states. Even meditation, the study of the self, is on this spectrum. Each of us is always and forever knowledge gardening, reading and writing information in different media, usually only the brain.

Tech can augment how we process information -- witness the written word, the printing press, or the internet. Knowledge gardening apps take another step in that direction, by making it easier yet to organize and process a large body of accumulated information. And Skg would take yet another, by permitting us to scale how we share our information processing, without exhausting our attention.
