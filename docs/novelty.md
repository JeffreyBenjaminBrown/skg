Skg is the first app that lets a user:
# Subscribe granularly.
In Skg you do not subscribe as a person to another person. Instead, you subscribe your individual documents (or sections thereof) to other peoples' individual documents (or sections thereof).

Thus, when you open your file on X, you will see what others have been thinking about X, without being flooded by their thoughts on other topics. Moreover, you can subscribe to what A says about X and what B says about Y, without needing to see what A says about Y or what B says about X.

In a world of scarce attention overflowing with information, granular subscription will help.
# Share granularly.
You can share not just whole documents, but selected parts of documents. Public and private sections will be visually distinct -- red and green, say.

This lets you integrate your private and public thinking, without exposing anything you want to withhold. If you have, for instance, private and public thoughts on love, you can work on them both in the same space, without exposing any of the private thoughts. When you want to view your work in "public mode" (maybe to share your screen) the private parts will be hidden.
# Manipulate others' data as if it were your own, while staying informed of their changes.
If another user shares data with you, you can navigate, edit and reshape it just like it was yours. When you modify it, your data transparently gains a "lens" onto their document. The lens is like a clone, except it's still connected to the original via subscription. You don't really change the other author's data, and if you want to see the original, you can. But your lens onto their data is yours, so you can rearrange its contents, edit them, and scatter them across your other files. Until you remove the subscription, anything the other author adds to the original note will be visible from your lens as new "unintegrated subscribed content".
# Learn from how others integrate your notes into theirs.
Suppose I have a lens onto one of your notes. If I want, I can make my lens public. If you want, you can configure your system to be aware of my public data. If both of those things happen, then when you visit your note that my lens subscribes to, you will see my subscription. If they want to investigate, they can find your lens (which of course can include private data visible only to you). This will let them see how your conception of the topic differs from theirs, what else you consider relevant, etc.

In this way, when you study others' writing, you can help them understand the topics they wrote about, without requiring any extra effort on your part.
