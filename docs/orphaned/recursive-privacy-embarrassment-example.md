# Recursive Privacy Embarrassment Example

For instance, you might have a note on "motivation", with safely publishable sections about hope, commitment, confidence, realism, etc. And you might want to give it a private branch called "embarrassing ambitions", with branches like "Speak on behalf of the trees" or "Immortality through identity loss".

Skg will let you make "embarrassing ambitions" a private branch of your public "motivation" document. Nobody else will see your private branch, but to you it will appear alongside your other thoughts on motivation.

This kind of public/private context switching in the tree is recursive: Just as a private branch can be part of public content, some branch inside that private branch can again be public. For instance, your private "immortality through identity loss" might in turn contain the public branches "publishing" and "biological reproduction". (Since those two public branches are only connected to "motivations" through intervening private nodes, they would be invisible from "motivations", but could still be accessible from other contexts.)
