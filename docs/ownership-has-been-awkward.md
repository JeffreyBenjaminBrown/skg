# Data ownership has been awkward.
In the data ownership model everyone knows, some people can see and change a document, and others can only see it. Those who can only see it cannot contribute, which deprives the entire community of potential knowledge. Those who can also change the document might disagree, and those conflicts, too, lead to the loss of ideas and perspectives.

By contrast, the Skg data model permits a multiverse of frameworks to coexist and cooperate, without getting in each others' way.
