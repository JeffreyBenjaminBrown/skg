# Preempting some common concerns

## Skg is free and open-source.
Extremely so -- see the [[license](LICENSE.md)]. No tyrant in the cloud will control your data.

## Anonymity and lurking are both fine.
A user may use anything others have shared while keeping their own information completely private. Nothing in the sharing model requires revealing authorship.

## "Public" and "private" are not a straightjacket; they're just two points on a spectrum.
In indivisual documents and even sections of documents, a user can define exactly who to share with. But in this documentation I'll avoid talking about that kind of selectivity, because the words public and private get the ideas across.
