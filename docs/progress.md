# What's done, and what's left to do
For that plan and more in greater detail (plus architectural observations, conceptual problems, and more), see [my org-roam notes on Skg](https://github.com/JeffreyBenjaminBrown/public_notes_with_github-navigable_links/blob/main/shareable_knowledge_gardens.org).
## What's done
This code so far includes a Rust server and an Emacs client. The server can:

- read and write to files in a format called .skg (it's just .yaml, but not all .yaml is .skg)
- build, modify and consult a model of the data in TypeDB
- build, by consulting TypeDB, a document to send Emacs

The client can:

- Receive that document, interpret it, and display it.
- Let the user edit it.
## What's partially done
### Save data
The client can request saved data and manipulate it.

The client can't send anything back to Rust. And if it could, Rust wouldn't know what to do with it. (It should save the data to disk, update TypeDB and Tantivy, and silently replace the Emacs document with a new one with IDs where the user had created new headlines without IDs.) This is sketched in a little more detail in [TODO.org](../devel-handy/TODO.org).
### Inhomogeneous, multidimensional trees
The database is implemented in TypeDB. which should make the required queries easy. Otherwise this is completely unimplemented.

Multidimensionality would mean incorporating into the tree view of some data relationships beyond the "x contains y in document d" for one fixed d. Instead, the document/view could vary throughout the tree, and some nodes could include branches corresponding to foreign data that links into them. The branches shown under a node do not have to all be of the same sort, because intermediating branches can classify them.

A refactor in which the containment relationship were tripartite, "[node] contains [node] from point of view of [node]", would make this more natural.
### Sharing
The user experience for sharing, and the [data model for sharing](sharing-model.md), have been documented. The [schema](../schema.tql) includes the necessary relations. Rust can already read those relationships from disk and write them into TypeDB.

There is not yet code to modify or view them.
