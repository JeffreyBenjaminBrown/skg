# Sharing information is good.
Anyone familiar with the processes of science, journalism, law or government knows about the power of larger groups to building and using knowledge.

Anybody who has shared notes in a good student group has felt the benefits that even a small number of people focused on a small sliver of reality can achieve. (Einstein's study group, the Olympia Academy, was usually just three people.)

If the above are unfamiliar, but you know how helpful taking notes has been for your own understanding, just imagine doing that with good collaborators. (Yes, your collaborators will be good, because Skg lets you control your view of others' work. You won't have to see contributions you don't care about.)
