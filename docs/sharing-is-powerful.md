# Sharing information is good.
Anyone familiar with the processes of science, journalism, law or government knows about the power of larger groups to building and using knowledge.

Anybody who has shared notes in a good student group has felt the benefits that even a small number of people focused on a small sliver of reality can achieve. (Einstein's study group, which he loved, was usually just three people. They called themselves The Olympia Academy.)

If the above experiences sound alien, but you know how helpful taking notes has been for your own understanding, just imagine how much more you could do with even just a few good collaborators.
