# Who maps knowledge?

There is a lot of software for it, and some of that software is very popular. It includes OneNote, Notion, TheBrain, LogSeq, Roam Research, org-roam, Tana, Obsidian and others. If you have met someone who uses one of these, chances are good they feel *very strongly* that it is helpful.

Mapping knowledge is so natural that many people have "discovered" it independently. You may have encountered it under some other name:

- Personal Knowledge Management
- Note-taking
- Concept Mapping
- Mind Mapping
- Linked Notes
- Networked Thinking
- Knowledge Base
- Knowledge Graph
- Second Brain
- Tools for Thought
- Zettelkasten
- Digital Garden
- Epistemic Engineering
