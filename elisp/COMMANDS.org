* user-facing skg commands
** whole buffer requests
*** skg-open-empty-content-view.el
*** skg-request-title-matches
asks Rust to search the Tantivy index
for titles matching the search terms,
and displays the results in a buffer.
*** skg-request-single-root-content-view-from-id
causes Emacs to ask Rust to ask TypeDB for a content-view document
containing the node with the specified ID.
Rust builds an s-expression representing an org-document
based on the result, and sends that to Emacs,
causing Emacs to open an org-mode buffer displaying the results.
*** skg-request-save-buffer
** ids
*** skg-next-id
*** skg-previous-id
*** skg-push-id-to-stack
*** skg-validate-id-stack-buffer
*** skg-replace-id-stack-from-buffer
*** skg-edit-id-stack
** links
*** skg-visit-link
** view requests
*** skg-request-aliases-view
*** skg-request-containerward-view
*** skg-request-sourceward-view
** metadata edits
*** skg-set-metadata-indefinitive
*** skg-edit-first-sexpr-on-line
*** skg-edit-sexp-at-or-after-point
** misc
*** heralds-minor-mode
*** org-ancestry
** git diff mode
*** skg-git-diff-toggle
Toggles git diff mode on the server.
When enabled, subsequent content views and saves are annotated
with git diff information (what changed between HEAD and worktree).
Save the buffer (~skg-request-save-buffer~)
or request a fresh content view to see the effect.
** tcp (likely never needed)
*** skg-doc-disconnect
*** skg-verify-connection
sends a simple ping to the Rust server
to verify the connection is working. The server responds with a
confirmation message that is displayed in the minibuffer.

Surprisingly, the TCP connection
does not need to be explicitly launched,
because each of the client's `request-*` functions
calls `(skg-tcp-connect-to-rust)`
(which is idempotent and cheap to rerun).
