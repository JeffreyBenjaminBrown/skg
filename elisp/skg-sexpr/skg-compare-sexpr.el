  "Check if STRUCTURE is a semantic subtree of OBJECT.

The comparison treats the first element of each list as a 'head' that
must match exactly, while remaining elements are treated as an unordered
set with recursive matching for sublists.

Examples:
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a b c) '(a))             => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a b c) '(a c b))         => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a b c) '(a c))           => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a b c) '(c a b))         => nil
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a (b c d) e) '(a e))     => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a (b c d) e) '(a (b)))   => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a (b c d) e) '(a (b c))) => t
  (skg-sexp-subtree-p '(a (b c d) e) '(a (c b))) => nil"
