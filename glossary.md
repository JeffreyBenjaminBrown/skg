# Some terms and abbreviations used in the code

## lp = length-prefixed

Sometimes an API response is prefixed with a length, letting the receiver know how many characters to expect in the response.

## title != headline

Headline is a term from org-mode. It refers to a line that begins with some asterisks, followed by at least one whitespace, followed by at least one non-whitespace. The text after the first chunk of adjacent whitespace is what I'm calling the 'title'.
