#+title: Temporary Changes During Multi-Source Implementation
#+date: 2025-11-11

* Purpose

This document tracks temporary workarounds added during Phase 1 to get the code compiling after removing =skg_folder=. These changes will be properly implemented in later phases.

* Resolved

** rust/init.rs (Lines 30-37)

*** What was changed
File loading was hardcoded to only read from the "main" source.

*** Temporary implementation (now removed)
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 3: Replace with read_all_skg_files_from_sources
// For now, temporarily read from "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source : &SkgfileSource =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
let skg_folder_str: &str =
  main_source . path
  . to_str () . expect ("Invalid UTF-8 in skg folder path");
#+end_src

*** Resolution (Phase 3)
Replaced with proper multi-source loading:
- Implemented =read_all_skg_files_from_sources= in =rust/media/file_io/multiple_nodes.rs=
- Updated =initialize_dbs= to call the new function
- Function iterates over all sources and sets source field correctly
- Added duplicate ID detection across sources

*** Status
✓ Resolved in Phase 3

* Unresolved

** rust/util.rs (Lines 17-27)

*** What was changed
=path_from_pid= function hardcoded to use "main" source instead of accepting a source parameter.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Update signature to accept source parameter
// For now, temporarily read from "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source : &SkgfileSource =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
let skg_folder_str: &str =
  main_source . path
  . to_str () . expect ("Invalid UTF-8 in skg folder path");
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 3)
- Create =read_all_skg_files_from_sources= function
- Iterate over all sources in =config.sources=
- Set =source= field on each loaded SkgNode based on which source it came from
- Add duplicate ID detection across sources

** rust/util.rs (Lines 17-27)

*** What was changed
=path_from_pid= function hardcoded to use "main" source instead of accepting a source parameter.

*** Current signature
#+begin_src rust
pub fn path_from_pid (
  config : &SkgConfig,
  pid    : ID,
) -> String
#+end_src

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Update signature to accept source parameter
// For now, use "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
let f : PathBuf = main_source . path . clone() ;
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
**** New signature
#+begin_src rust
pub fn path_from_pid (
  config : &SkgConfig,
  source : &str,  // Add this parameter
  pid    : ID,
) -> String
#+end_src

**** Implementation
- Look up source by nickname in =config.sources=
- Use that source's path
- Update all call sites to pass source parameter

** rust/media/file_io/multiple_nodes.rs (Lines 37-44)

*** What was changed
=write_all_nodes_to_fs= hardcoded to write to "main" source.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Write to appropriate source based on node.source
// For now, use "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
fs::create_dir_all (
  // Ensure entire path to folder exists
  &main_source . path )?;
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- For each node, look up =node.source= in =config.sources=
- Use that source's path to construct file path
- Create directory for that source if needed
- Write file to appropriate source directory

** rust/save.rs (Lines 111-113)

*** What was changed
Print statement made generic instead of showing target directory.

*** Old implementation
#+begin_src rust
let target_dir : &Path = &config.skg_folder;
println!( "2) Writing {} instruction(s) to disk at {:?} ...",
           total_input, target_dir );
#+end_src

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Print per-source write information
println!( "2) Writing {} instruction(s) to disk ...",
           total_input );
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Group nodes by source
- Print write information per source
- Show counts per source directory

** rust/save/orgnodes_to_instructions/reconcile_dup_instructions.rs (Lines 100-105)

*** What was changed
=reconcile_dup_instructions_for_one_id= computes reconciled source but doesn't use it yet.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// Reconcile source from buffer orgnodes first (before reading from disk)
let reconciled_source_value : String =
  reconciled_source (
    &indefinitives, definer.as_ref() ) ?;

// TODO Phase 5: Use reconciled_source_value to determine which .skg file to read
// For now, path_from_pid uses "main" source
let from_disk: Option<SkgNode> = {
  let primary_id: ID = ...
  read_node_from_id_optional(
    config, driver, &primary_id).await? };
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Use =reconciled_source_value= to determine which .skg file to read
- Update =read_node_from_id_optional= call to use the reconciled source
- Remove underscore prefix from variable name once it's used

*** Note
The =reconciled_source()= function itself (lines 214-225) is properly implemented and not temporary. Only the variable that stores its result is unused for now.

** rust/media/file_io/one_node.rs (Multiple locations)

*** What was changed
All functions that read nodes from disk now set source to "main" after deserialization.

*** Current implementation
In =read_node_from_id()= (lines 26-28):
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Determine source from file path instead of hardcoding "main"
let mut node : SkgNode =
  read_node (node_file_path) ?;
node.source = "main".to_string();
#+end_src

Similar changes in =fetch_aliases_from_file()= (lines 63-64).

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Parse the file path to determine which source it belongs to
- Look up source nickname from path by comparing against all =config.sources= paths
- Set =node.source= to the correct source nickname

** rust/media/file_io/multiple_nodes.rs (Lines 26-28)

*** What was changed
=read_all_nodes_from_fs()= sets source to "main" after reading each node.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Determine source from dir_path instead of hardcoding "main"
let mut node = read_node (&path) ?;
node.source = "main".to_string();
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Determine source from =dir_path= parameter
- Set correct source for each node based on which directory it came from

** rust/merge/mergeInstructionTriple.rs (Lines 53-61)

*** What was changed
Both =acquirer_from_disk= and =acquiree_from_disk= have source set to "main" after reading.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Determine source from path instead of hardcoding "main"
let mut acquirer_from_disk: SkgNode = read_node(...)?;
acquirer_from_disk.source = "main".to_string();
let mut acquiree_from_disk: SkgNode = read_node(...)?;
acquiree_from_disk.source = "main".to_string();
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Determine source from the path returned by =path_from_pid=
- Set correct source for each node

** Additional file reading locations

Similar temporary changes in:
- =rust/save/orgnodes_to_instructions/none_node_fields_are_noops.rs= (lines 44-45)
- =rust/rebuild/complete_aliascol.rs= (lines 39-40)
- =rust/rebuild/complete_contents.rs= (lines 239-240)
- =rust/mk_org_text/content_view.rs= (2 locations: lines 190-191, 213-214)
- =tests/file_io.rs= (3 locations)

All follow the same pattern: read node, then set =node.source = "main".to_string()=.

** Impact

*** Current functionality (after Phase 3)
- Code compiles and runs
- Can load from multiple sources simultaneously
- Source field is properly set for all loaded nodes
- Duplicate IDs across sources are detected and rejected
- File writing still uses "main" source only (Phase 5)
- Path generation still uses "main" source only (Phase 5)

*** What still doesn't work (pending Phase 5)
- Cannot write nodes to different sources (all write to "main")
- Path generation doesn't use node's source field yet
- 10 locations where source is hardcoded after reading from disk

** Testing implications

All existing tests work because they use a single "main" source via the test helper in =rust/test_utils.rs= (lines 105-113).

** Removal plan
