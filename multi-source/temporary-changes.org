#+title: Temporary Changes During Multi-Source Implementation
#+date: 2025-11-11

* Purpose

This document tracks temporary workarounds added during Phase 1 to get the code compiling after removing =skg_folder=. These changes will be properly implemented in later phases.

* Temporary Changes

** rust/init.rs (Lines 30-37)

*** What was changed
File loading was hardcoded to only read from the "main" source.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 3: Replace with read_all_skg_files_from_sources
// For now, temporarily read from "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source : &SkgfileSource =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
let skg_folder_str: &str =
  main_source . path
  . to_str () . expect ("Invalid UTF-8 in skg folder path");
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 3)
- Create =read_all_skg_files_from_sources= function
- Iterate over all sources in =config.sources=
- Set =source= field on each loaded SkgNode based on which source it came from
- Add duplicate ID detection across sources

** rust/util.rs (Lines 17-27)

*** What was changed
=path_from_pid= function hardcoded to use "main" source instead of accepting a source parameter.

*** Current signature
#+begin_src rust
pub fn path_from_pid (
  config : &SkgConfig,
  pid    : ID,
) -> String
#+end_src

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Update signature to accept source parameter
// For now, use "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
let f : PathBuf = main_source . path . clone() ;
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
**** New signature
#+begin_src rust
pub fn path_from_pid (
  config : &SkgConfig,
  source : &str,  // Add this parameter
  pid    : ID,
) -> String
#+end_src

**** Implementation
- Look up source by nickname in =config.sources=
- Use that source's path
- Update all call sites to pass source parameter

** rust/media/file_io/multiple_nodes.rs (Lines 37-44)

*** What was changed
=write_all_nodes_to_fs= hardcoded to write to "main" source.

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Write to appropriate source based on node.source
// For now, use "main" source to get Phase 1 compiling
let main_source =
  config . sources . get ( "main" )
  . expect ( "Config must have a 'main' source" );
fs::create_dir_all (
  // Ensure entire path to folder exists
  &main_source . path )?;
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- For each node, look up =node.source= in =config.sources=
- Use that source's path to construct file path
- Create directory for that source if needed
- Write file to appropriate source directory

** rust/save.rs (Lines 111-113)

*** What was changed
Print statement made generic instead of showing target directory.

*** Old implementation
#+begin_src rust
let target_dir : &Path = &config.skg_folder;
println!( "2) Writing {} instruction(s) to disk at {:?} ...",
           total_input, target_dir );
#+end_src

*** Current implementation
#+begin_src rust
// TODO Phase 5: Print per-source write information
println!( "2) Writing {} instruction(s) to disk ...",
           total_input );
#+end_src

*** Proper implementation (Phase 5)
- Group nodes by source
- Print write information per source
- Show counts per source directory

* Impact

** Current functionality
- Code compiles and runs
- Supports exactly one source with nickname "main"
- All file operations use "main" source
- No multi-source functionality yet

** What doesn't work
- Cannot configure multiple sources (they would be ignored)
- Cannot load from multiple directories
- Cannot write nodes to different sources
- Source field exists but is not properly set or used

* Testing implications

All existing tests work because they use a single "main" source via the test helper in =rust/test_utils.rs= (lines 105-113).

* Removal plan

** Phase 3: File Loading with Sources
- Remove temporary code in =rust/init.rs=
- Implement =read_all_skg_files_from_sources=

** Phase 5: Path Generation and File Writing
- Remove temporary code in =rust/util.rs=
- Remove temporary code in =rust/media/file_io/multiple_nodes.rs=
- Remove temporary code in =rust/save.rs=
- Update all call sites of =path_from_pid=
