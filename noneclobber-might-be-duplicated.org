* supplement_from_disk_if_save and noneclobber_skgnode overlap

** Summary

Both functions do the same thing: replace None fields in a SkgNode
with values read from disk. They are called sequentially on every
Save instruction in viewnode_forest_to_nonmerge_save_instructions.
This means every Save hits disk twice, and the second pass
(noneclobber) is largely redundant.

** What each function does

*** supplement_from_disk_if_save (viewnodes_to_instructions.rs)

Reads disk via =optskgnode_from_id= (which calls =pid_and_source_from_id=
then =skgnode_from_pid_and_source=).

For each of these fields, replaces None with the disk value:
- aliases
- subscribes_to
- hides_from_its_subscriptions
- overrides_view_of

Does NOT none-clobber:
- body (copies buffer value as-is)
- contains (copies buffer value as-is)

Also does two extra things noneclobber does not:
1. Validates that buffer source matches disk source (returns error if not)
2. Supplements =ids= with extra IDs from disk (via =supplement_ids=)

*** noneclobber_skgnode (none_node_fields_are_noops.rs)

Reads disk via =pid_and_source_from_id= then =skgnode_from_pid_and_source=
(same two underlying calls, just done separately rather than through
=optskgnode_from_id=).

For each of these fields, replaces None with the disk value:
- aliases
- contains
- subscribes_to
- hides_from_its_subscriptions
- overrides_view_of

Does NOT do:
- source validation
- id supplementation

** Where they overlap

| Field                          | build_disk.. | noneclobber |
|--------------------------------+--------------+-------------|
| aliases                        | clobbers     | clobbers    |
| subscribes_to                  | clobbers     | clobbers    |
| hides_from_its_subscriptions   | clobbers     | clobbers    |
| overrides_view_of              | clobbers     | clobbers    |
| contains                       | passes thru  | clobbers    |
| body                           | passes thru  | no          |
| ids                            | supplements  | no          |
| source validation              | yes          | no          |

For the four shared fields (aliases, subscribes_to,
hides_from_its_subscriptions, overrides_view_of), the second pass
through noneclobber is a no-op: supplement_from_disk_if_save already
replaced any None with the disk value, so noneclobber finds Some(...)
and skips.

** The one field that actually matters in noneclobber

=contains= is the only field where noneclobber does something
supplement_from_disk_if_save does not. supplement_from_disk_if_save
passes =contains= through unchanged. If it's None after that,
noneclobber fills it from disk.

** Possible resolutions

1. *Merge into one function.* Add =contains= clobbering and keep
   source validation + id supplementation. Delete the other.
   Saves one disk read per instruction.

2. *Have supplement_from_disk_if_save also clobber =contains=.*
   Then noneclobber becomes fully redundant and can be deleted.

3. *Move source validation and id supplementation into noneclobber,*
   and delete supplement_from_disk_if_save.

Options 1 and 2 are essentially the same. Option 3 is the mirror image.
All three eliminate the redundant second disk read.
