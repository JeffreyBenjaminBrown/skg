PITFALL: We treat a node as indefinitive if 'repeat' OR 'indefinitive' is true. But the only time it is marked as 'repeat' is when Rust builds a content view and discovers the node has already been rendered. By contrast, when a node marked 'repeat' is saved, since the user may have edited it, the 'repeat' label is replaced with 'indefinitive'. And 'repeat' detection is skipped entirely for 'indefinitive' nodes, so it will thereafter appear without the 'repeat' marker.
TODO : Is this ugly? I don't want to have to keep 'repeat' and 'indefinitive' in sync. In Rust, the function 'change_repeated_to_indefinitive', which is called each time a buffer is saved, ensures that the server knows to treat each repeated node as indefinitive. But in the Emacs client, nothing encodes the relationship between the two fields. */
