* goal
Code for transforming a sexp into org-text,
and vice-versa, losslessly.
It only needs to work for
  a narrow class of especially convenient sexps that I call
  'atom-headed paren-terse list sexps',
  and a narrow class of org expressions anyone might call
  'bodyless org text'.
The two functions should be called
  sexp-to-org
  org-to-sexp
org-to-sexp should discard all body text before transforming.
  (So it's not really a bijection.)
  It should refuse if the passage contains multiple roots,
  or if there is a jump where the first child of a headline is indented more than one level beyond its parent, as in:
    * a
    *** b
  or
    * a
    ** b ;; fine
    **** d ;; not fine
sexp-to-org should refuse unless its input is all of
  atom-headed, paren-terse and 'list' (i.e. not a bare atom).
* "atom-headedness"
  A sexp is atom-headed if it,
  and every sublist contained within it at any level,
  has a bare atom as its first member.
  So (a (a (a (a)))) qualifies,
  as does (a b (a b (a b)) a b),
  but ((a)) does not qualify,
  nor does ((a) b),
  nor (a ((b) a)).
* "paren-terseness"
  No proper sub-sexp of a paren-terse sexp
    puts parens around a single atom.
** examples that are paren-terse
   (a)
   (a b)
   (a (b c) d)
   (a (b (c d)) e (f g))
** counter-examples
   ;; All but one of these are also disallowed by the atom-headedness requirement.
   ((a))
   ((a b))
   (a (b) c) ;; This one *is* atom-headed, but the (b) violates paren-terseness.
   (a ((a b)))
* a note on formatting
  The org-text passages described in this document
  are indented to the left. That's just for my convenience.
  In fact there should be no whitespace to the left of the bullets
  in those passages, consistent with the org format.
  To translate, find the minimum whitespace margin across all lines
  of a passage, and subtract that amount of whitespace from every line.
* transformations
  These should, I believe, all be bijective.
** the simplest case : (a)
*** this sexp
    (a)
*** should correspond to this org-text
    * a
** (a b) should correspond to this org-text
    * a
    ** b
** ((a) b) is invalid.
   It is not atom-headed.
** (a (b a)) should correspond to this org-text
   * a
   ** b
   *** a
** (a (b a) c) should correspond to this org-text
   * a
   ** b
   *** a
   ** c
** Whitespace in symbols and headlines is permissible.
*** (a |b c| d) would map to
    * a
    ** b c
    ** d
