(ert-deftest test-skg-reload-preserves-herald-rules-on-load-error ()
  "A load error mid-reload must NOT strip the herald rule table.

Regression guard for a volatile-session-state bug: the herald rule
table is fetched once per connect (`skg-request-herald-rules') and has
no on-disk source.  `skg-reload' unloads `heralds-minor-mode' -- which
wipes the table -- and is supposed to re-install the captured copy
afterward.  When the re-install was a plain sequential step, any error
in a reloaded file (a stray edit-in-progress, say) aborted `skg-reload'
before that step, leaving the table nil for the rest of the session;
every `heralds-minor-mode' toggle then reported \"no herald rule table
from the server\" even though the server was healthy.

The fix wraps the re-install in `unwind-protect'.  Here we stub the
destructive `skg--reload-modules' so the real reload machinery never
runs (no feature is actually unloaded); the stub mimics the failure by
wiping the table and signalling.  `skg-reload' must still surface the
error AND leave the captured table installed."
