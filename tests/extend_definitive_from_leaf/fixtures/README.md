# Test Fixture Files

## Structure

The ID-prefix relationship defines containment:
if node A's ID is a prefix of node B's ID, then A contains B.

Every node has a body equal to "ID body" where ID is the node's ID.

There are no other relationships (no textlinks, subscriptions, hides, or overrides).
