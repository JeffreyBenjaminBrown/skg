* scenario
** on disk
   Node 1 has title 1, ids [1,2,3],
   and contains a node called 'child' whose title equals its id.
   There are no other nodes.
** in worktree
   Identical, except node 1 now has ids [1,2',3] --
   the 2 has become 2'.
* expectated git diff view
  If the root IDs of the view are the singleton set [1],
  then the view should look like:
  * 1
  ** (skg (scaffold idCol))
  *** (skg (scaffold id) 1
  *** (skg (scaffold id) (diff removed)) 2
  *** (skg (scaffold id) (diff new)) 2'
  *** 3
  ** child
  (I might have the metadata format wrong but that's the idea.)
* expected save behavior
  editing any of the idCol's children, or the idCol with its children,
  or even moving the IDs to be siblings or children of 'child',
  should have no effect on disk or in the buffer.
