* what these tests do
** test scenario
   For this test description, most orgnode metadata is omitted.
   IDs are equal to titles unless otherwise indicated.
*** head
    * 1
    ** 11
    11 has a body.
    ** 12
*** worktree
    * (skg (truenode (id 1) ..)..) 1 has a new title.
    ** 11
    11 has a new body.
    ** 12
** expected git-diff view
    * (skg (truenode (id 1) ..)..) 1 has a new title.
    ** (skg textChanged) ;; or something; I'm not sure what the exact metadata syntax is for a TextChanged
    ** 11
    11 has a new body.
    *** (skg textChanged) ;; or something; I'm not sure what the exact metadata syntax is for a TextChanged
    ** 12
** expectation upon saving
   Edits to either textChanged are entirely disregarded --
   they have no effect on disk,
   and an edited textChanged node will respawn in the buffer.
   This is true if they are edited,
   if they are moved, or if they are deleted.
   Even if one is moved to be a child of a node
   whose text *was not edited*,
   the disk state and returned buffer will be unaffected.
