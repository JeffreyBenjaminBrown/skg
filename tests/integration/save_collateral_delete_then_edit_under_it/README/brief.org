The initial data looks like this:

#+begin_example
  * 1
  ** 11
  *** (aliasCol)
  **** (alias) eleven
  *** (subscribeeCol)
  **** subee
  ***** (HiddenInSubscribeeCol)
  ****** subee-1
  **** (hiddenoutsideofsubscribeecol)
  ***** also-hidden
  * subee
  ** subee-1
#+end_example

That is:
- as usual for tests, all nodes have titles equal to their IDs
- node 1 has a single child, 11
- 11 subscribes to subee
- subee has a child subee-1, and 11 hides it
- 11 also hides the node called "also-hidden", which is a node with
  no other connection to anything, just its ID and title
- 11 has an alias, "eleven"

Notice that subee appears twice in that buffer:
Once as a subscribee, and once as a standalone root.

In a second buffer we have just two roots, 11 and subee,
with none of the scaffolding:

#+begin_example
  * (indef) 11 ;; indefinite to avoid seeing its content
  * subee
  ** subee-1
#+end_example

From that buffer we remove 'indef' from 11's metadata,
add a delete request to 11, and save.
Now the first buffer should look like:

#+begin_example
  * 1
  ** (deleted)
  *** (deletedscaff)
  **** subee
  ***** subee-1  ;; tricky!
  ***** (deletedscaff)
  ****** subee-1
  **** (deletedscaff)
  ***** also-hidden
  * subee
  ** subee-1
#+end_example

That "tricky" line happens because subee gets completed
(via "complete_viewtree") when the buffer is saved.

And now we go a step further:
We make an edit from the view with deleted nodes.
In particular, let's add a new node with the title subee-2
to subee:

#+begin_example
  * 1
  ** (deleted)
  *** (deletedscaff)
  **** subee
  ***** subee-1
  ***** subee-2 ;; NEW
  ***** (deletedscaff)
  ****** subee-1
  **** (deletedscaff)
  ***** also-hidden
  * subee
  ** subee-1
  ** subee-2
#+end_example

After saving that, the other buffer should now read:

#+begin_example
  * (deleted) 11
  * subee
  ** subee-1
  ** subee-2
#+end_example

And finally, we re-save the first buffer with a new node
(new-root) inserted as a sibling of subee under the
deletedScaff. This exercises the round-trip: Deleted and
DeletedScaff nodes are parsed back from text, pass through
completion, and render unchanged. The new node gets a UUID.

#+begin_example
  * 1
  ** (deleted)
  *** (deletedscaff)
  **** subee
  **** new-root ;; NEW, now has a UUID
  **** (deletedscaff)
  ***** also-hidden
  * subee
  ** subee-1
  ** subee-2
#+end_example
