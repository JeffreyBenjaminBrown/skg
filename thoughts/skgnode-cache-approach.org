* Alternative: SkgNode Cache Instead of Paired Trees

** The Problem
~definitive_branch.rs~ refetches SkgNodes that were already fetched during completion.
User wants to eliminate this waste.

** Option 1: Change All Trees to Paired
Change the entire pipeline to use ~Tree<(SkgNode, OrgNode)>~.
This is a large refactor touching many files.

** Option 2: SkgNode Cache
Keep ~Tree<OrgNode>~ but pass a ~HashMap<ID, SkgNode>~ cache alongside.

During completion, populate the cache when we fetch SkgNodes.
During definitive expansion, check the cache before fetching.

Pros:
- Minimal code changes
- No tree type changes
- Still eliminates refetches

Cons:
- An extra data structure to thread through
- Doesn't match ~initial_view_bfs~ structure exactly

** Which Is Better?

The user specifically asked to "use the same kind of tree of (skgnode, orgnode) pairs".
This suggests Option 1 is preferred.

However, the buffer parsing fundamentally produces OrgNodes from text, not (SkgNode, OrgNode) pairs.
We could wrap them as ~(empty_skgnode(), OrgNode)~ but that's awkward.

A compromise: Use ~Tree<(Option<SkgNode>, OrgNode)>~ where:
- Buffer-parsed nodes have ~None~
- Completed/expanded nodes have ~Some(SkgNode)~

This allows gradually populating SkgNodes as we fetch them, while keeping the tree structure.
