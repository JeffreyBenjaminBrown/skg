=== Plan: Generation 1 - Simple SubscribeeCol ===

* Goal

When rendering content for a node N that subscribes to anything, render a SubscribeeCol child. Just one generation - no children of the SubscribeeCol yet.

* Structure
#+begin_example
Content Node N (subscribes_to = [S1, S2, ...])
└── SubscribeeCol
    - relToParent = SubscribeeCol
    - indefinitive = false (definitive)
    - title = "it subscribes to these"
    - no source
    - no id
    - no SkgNode
    - no children (for now)
├── (normal content children)
├── (normal content children)
├── ...
#+end_example

* Required Changes

** 1. Add =RelToParent::SubscribeeCol= variant

File: =rust/types/orgnode.rs=

Add to the =RelToParent= enum:
#+begin_src rust
SubscribeeCol, // Collects subscribees for its parent
#+end_src

** 2. Update sexp rendering for the new variant
(Parsing will be handled later.)

File: =rust/types/orgnode.rs=

In =orgnodemd_to_string= (or wherever relToParent is rendered to sexp), add case for SubscribeeCol.

** 3. Create the SubscribeeCol during content completion
Jeff asks: This way it will be included both when generating an initial view, *and* when rebuilding after a save-buffer operation, yes?
Claude: Yes, `completeDefinitiveOrgnode` is called from both code paths.

File: =rust/to_org/complete/contents.rs=

In =completeDefinitiveOrgnode=, after ensuring the SkgNode exists:
- Check if =skgnode.subscribes_to= is non-empty
- If so, check if a SubscribeeCol child already exists (similar pattern to aliases check)
- If no SubscribeeCol exists, create one and prepend/append it to non-content children

Helper function (either in =contents.rs= or a new =rust/to_org/complete/subscribeecol.rs=):
#+begin_src rust
fn maybe_add_subscribee_col (
  tree    : &mut PairTree,
  node_id : NodeId,
) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
#+end_src

** 4. Handle SubscribeeCol in traversal

File: =rust/to_org/complete/contents.rs=

In =completeAndRestoreNode_collectingDefinitiveRequests=:
- Add case for =RelToParent::SubscribeeCol=
- For now, just skip recursion (no children to process)
- Or let it fall through to normal processing since it has no children anyway

** 5. Ensure SubscribeeCol is treated as non-content

The existing =categorize_children_by_treatment= already puts non-Content children in =non_content_child_ids=, so SubscribeeCol will automatically be placed before content children in the reordering step.

* Files to Modify

1. =rust/types/orgnode.rs= - Add RelToParent::SubscribeeCol, update rendering
2. =rust/to_org/complete/contents.rs= - Create SubscribeeCol during completion
3. =rust/serve/parse_metadata_sexp.rs= - Parse "subscribeeCol" (later)

* Testing

- Create a test node that has =subscribes_to= with some IDs
- Verify that after completion, it has a SubscribeeCol child
- Verify the SubscribeeCol has correct properties (title, relToParent, definitive)
- Verify nodes without subscriptions don't get a SubscribeeCol

* Future Generations

Generation 2 will add Subscribee children to the SubscribeeCol.
Generation 3 will add Hidden/Unintegrated children to each Subscribee.
Generation 4 will add actual content nodes under Hidden/Unintegrated.
