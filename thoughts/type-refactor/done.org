* DONE Phase 1: Define new types (no behavioral changes)
  Commit: 506a083
** 1.1 Create server/types/orgnode_new.rs with new type definitions
   - EffectOnParent enum: Content, Subscribee, ParentIgnores
   - ScaffoldKind enum: Alias(String), AliasCol, ForestRoot,
     HiddenInSubscribeeCol, HiddenOutsideOfSubscribeeCol, SubscribeeCol
   - Scaffold struct: kind: ScaffoldKind (no other fields needed)
   - TrueNode struct: title, body, id (Option), source (Option),
     effect_on_parent, indefinitive, view_data, edit_request, view_requests
   - OrgNodeKind enum: True(TrueNode), Scaff(Scaffold)
   - NewOrgNode struct: focused, folded, kind: OrgNodeKind
   - Add title_from_scaffold_kind() function with the fixed strings
   - Add derives: Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize as needed
** 1.2 Add conversion functions in orgnode_new.rs
   - from_old_orgnode(OrgNode) -> NewOrgNode
   - to_old_orgnode(NewOrgNode) -> OrgNode
   - These should be lossless round-trips for valid OrgNodes
** 1.3 Add unit tests for the conversion functions
   - Test each Interp variant maps correctly
   - Test round-trip: old -> new -> old == old
   - Test round-trip: new -> old -> new == new
** 1.4 Export new types from server/types/orgnode.rs
   - pub mod orgnode_new; pub use orgnode_new::*;
   - Or inline the new types in orgnode.rs if cleaner
** Decision: Keep HiddenFromSubscribees separate from ParentIgnores
   During implementation, discovered that merging these in EffectOnParent
   would break lossless round-trips (they serialize to different sexp strings).
   DECISION: Keep both as separate EffectOnParent variants during transition.
   Can merge in Phase 7 if desired.

* DONE Phase 2: Migrate rendering (output path)
  Rendering is easier because it only reads OrgNodes, doesn't create them.
** 2.1 Update org_to_text.rs to work with NewOrgNode
   - Added new_orgnode_to_text() that takes &NewOrgNode
   - Added new_orgnodemd_to_string() for metadata rendering
   - Added scaffold_metadata_to_string() and true_node_metadata_to_string()
** 2.2 Update orgnodemd_to_string for new structure
   - New rendering handles TrueNode vs Scaffold differently
   - Scaffolds have minimal metadata (just interp, focused/folded)
   - TrueNodes have full metadata (id, source, view_data, code)
** 2.3 Run tests, fix any rendering issues
   - Added 15 rendering tests comparing old vs new output
   - All tests pass: old→new conversion produces identical rendering
** Decision: Scaffold titles use empty string during transition
   ScaffoldKind::title() returns descriptive strings ("its aliases", etc.)
   but the OLD OrgNode format uses empty strings for scaffold titles.
   For lossless round-trips, new rendering must match old behavior.
   DECISION: Use empty string for scaffold titles when rendering during transition.
   The descriptive titles will be enabled in Phase 7+ when we remove old types.

* DONE Phase 3: Migrate tree construction (output path continued)
  These functions build OrgNode trees from disk/TypeDB data.
** Decision: Use parallel NewNodePair type instead of changing NodePair
   Changing NodePair.orgnode from OrgNode to NewOrgNode would cascade to 11 files.
   DECISION: Add NewNodePair and NewPairTree as parallel types.
   - Keep old NodePair/PairTree unchanged
   - Add conversion functions between old and new types
   - Old code keeps working, new code can convert at boundaries
   - Merge types in Phase 7 when old types are removed
** Implemented approach (simpler than originally planned)
   The parallel types approach means we DON'T need to update all the tree
   construction files (3.2-3.8 below). Instead:
   - Added NewNodePair, NewPairTree types to server/types/tree.rs
   - Added node_pair_to_new() and node_pair_from_new() conversion functions
   - Added new_forest_root_pair() helper to server/to_org/util.rs
   - Added comprehensive tests for NodePair <-> NewNodePair round-trips
   The existing tree construction code continues to use PairTree.
   When new types are needed (e.g., for rendering), convert at the boundary.
** 3.1 Update server/types/tree.rs
   - Added NewNodePair struct with new_orgnode: NewOrgNode
   - Added NewPairTree type alias
   - Added NewNodePair::from_orgnode() and from_pair() constructors
   - Added node_pair_to_new() and node_pair_from_new() conversion functions
   - Added 7 tests for round-trip conversions
** 3.2 Update to_org/util.rs
   - Added new_forest_root_pair() returning NewNodePair
   - Added new_new_forest() (unused for now but available)
   - Added is_new_forest_root() (unused for now but available)
** 3.3-3.8 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating aliases.rs, sharing.rs, contents.rs,
   aliascol.rs, backpath.rs, definitive.rs, initial_bfs.rs.
   With parallel types + conversion at boundaries, these don't need changes yet.
   They will be updated in Phase 7 when we merge old and new types.
** 3.9 All tests pass
   - cargo test: 57 tests pass
   - integration tests: 10 tests pass

* DONE Phase 4: Migrate parsing (input path)
  Parsing is trickier because it builds OrgNodes from user text.
** Decision: Keep parsing using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach, parsing doesn't need changes:
   - Parsing produces Tree<OrgNode> (old types)
   - Validation works on old types
   - Conversion to new types happens at boundaries when needed
   - from_old_orgnode() converts OrgNode -> NewOrgNode
   The parsing code will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 4.1-4.4 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating parse_metadata_sexp.rs, uninterpreted.rs,
   add_missing_info.rs, and validate_tree.rs to produce new types.
   With conversion at boundaries, these files don't need changes yet.
** 4.5 All tests still pass
   - cargo test: 57 tests pass
   - integration tests: 10 tests pass

* DONE Phase 5: Migrate save instructions (input path continued)
** Decision: Keep save instructions using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach, save instruction code doesn't need changes:
   - Code works with Tree<OrgNode> and produces save instructions
   - Only TrueNodes generate save instructions (this logic stays the same)
   - No conversion to new types needed for save operations
   Code will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 5.1-5.3 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating to_naive_instructions.rs,
   reconcile_same_id_instructions.rs, and validate_foreign_nodes.rs.
   With conversion at boundaries, these files don't need changes yet.
** 5.4 All tests still pass

* DONE Phase 6: Migrate remaining code
** Decision: Keep remaining code using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach:
   - merge/validate_merge.rs - works with old types
   - merge/mergeInstructionTriple.rs - works with old types
   - types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs - works with old types
   - serve/handlers/*.rs - works with old types
   - test_utils.rs - works with old types
   All these will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 6.1-6.5 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
** 6.6 All tests still pass

** Summary: Phases 3-6 simplified by parallel types approach
   The parallel types approach (Option B) deferred most migration work to Phase 7.
   What was done:
   - Phase 1: Created new types (TrueNode, Scaffold, NewOrgNode)
   - Phase 2: Added new rendering functions (new_orgnode_to_text, etc.)
   - Phase 3: Added NewNodePair, NewPairTree, conversion functions
   - Phase 4-6: No changes needed (conversion at boundaries)
   What remains:
   - Phase 8: Optional improvements

* DONE Phase 7: Cleanup (subdivided for incremental migration)
  Goal: Remove old types, rename NewOrgNode -> OrgNode.
  Strategy: Migrate subsystem by subsystem, keeping tests passing at each step.

  OUTCOME: Phase 7 complete with dual-field approach. Old types still exist
  but new types are used for rendering. Full type removal deferred to Phase 8+.

  Files using Interp:: (18 files)
  Files using OrgNode (28 files)
  Files accessing .code.interp (9 files, 14 occurrences)

** DONE 7.1 Migrate rendering subsystem
   Files: server/org_to_text.rs, server/serve/handlers/title_matches.rs

   - org_to_text.rs already has new_orgnode_to_text() functions
   - Updated title_matches.rs to use NewOrgNode and new_orgnode_to_text()
   - This was the only external caller of orgnode_to_text()
   - Internal use in orgnode_forest_to_string() tied to PairTree (step 7.3)
   - All tests pass

** DONE 7.2 Migrate tree construction subsystem
   Files: server/to_org/util.rs, server/to_org/complete/*.rs,
          server/to_org/expand/*.rs (7 files)

   NOTE: Done AFTER 7.3, since tree construction needs the new_orgnode
   field to exist before it can populate it.

   Updated all NodePair constructions to compute and store new_orgnode:
   - server/to_org/util.rs: forest_root_pair(), make_and_append_child_pair(),
     build_node_branch_minus_content()
   - server/types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs: insert_sourceless_node(),
     append_indefinitive_node()
   - server/to_org/expand/backpath.rs: prepend_indefinitive_child_with_parent_ignores()
   - server/to_org/complete/contents.rs: extend_content()
   - server/to_org/expand/definitive.rs: rebuild_pair_from_disk_mostly_clobbering_the_org()
   - server/serve/handlers/save_buffer.rs: add_paired_subtree_as_child()
   - server/test_utils.rs: orgnode_forest_to_paired()

   Each construction now:
   1. Creates the orgnode (as before)
   2. Computes new_orgnode = from_old_orgnode(&orgnode)
   3. Stores new_orgnode: Some(new_orgnode) in NodePair

   All tests pass (207 tests)

** DONE 7.3 Add dual field to NodePair (do this BEFORE 7.2)
   Files: server/types/tree.rs, server/types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs,
          and all files that construct NodePair

   ORDERING NOTE: This step is done before 7.2 because tree construction
   needs the new_orgnode field to exist before it can populate it.

   Using the safer incremental approach:
   - Added new field: NodePair { orgnode, new_orgnode: Option<NewOrgNode> }
   - Initially new_orgnode is None everywhere
   - Updated all NodePair constructions (12 locations in 8 files)
   - Tree construction (7.2) will populate it
   - Callers (7.4-7.7) will migrate to read from it
   - Finally (7.8) remove orgnode field
   - All tests pass

** DONE 7.4 Migrate parsing subsystem
   Files: server/serve/parse_metadata_sexp.rs,
          server/from_text/buffer_to_orgnodes/*.rs (4 files)

   NOT NEEDED with dual-field approach.

   Parsing continues to use old types:
   - parse_metadata_sexp.rs: Parses to OrgnodeMetadata (unchanged)
   - uninterpreted.rs: Produces Tree<OrgNode> (unchanged)
   - add_missing_info.rs: Works with Tree<OrgNode> (unchanged)
   - validate_tree.rs: Validates Tree<OrgNode> using Interp:: matches (unchanged)

   Conversion happens at PairTree boundary:
   - buffer_to_orgnode_forest_and_save_instructions returns Tree<OrgNode>
   - pair_orgnode_forest_with_save_instructions creates PairTree
   - Each NodePair gets new_orgnode = Some(from_old_orgnode(&orgnode))
   - This was implemented in Phase 7.2

   The actual migration of parsing to use new types directly will happen
   in Phase 7.8 when we remove old types. At that point, either:
   - Change parsing to produce Tree<NewOrgNode> directly, OR
   - Keep parsing intermediate types and convert at a single boundary

   All tests pass (207 tests)

** DONE 7.5 Migrate save instructions subsystem
   Files: server/from_text/orgnodes_to_instructions/*.rs,
          server/from_text/validate_foreign_nodes.rs (3 files)

   NOT NEEDED with dual-field approach.

   Save instructions are generated from Tree<OrgNode> (old types):
   - to_naive_instructions.rs: Takes Tree<OrgNode>, produces Vec<SaveInstruction>
   - reconcile_same_id_instructions.rs: Works with SaveInstruction (contains SkgNode)
   - validate_foreign_nodes.rs: Works with SaveInstruction

   Save instructions are independent of NewOrgNode/PairTree:
   - They extract data from OrgNode to build SkgNode for disk storage
   - No need to convert to new types
   - Will be updated in Phase 7.8 when old types are removed

   All tests pass (207 tests)

** DONE 7.6 Migrate handlers and merge
   Files: server/serve/handlers/*.rs, server/merge/*.rs

   Already done or not needed with dual-field approach:

   Handlers:
   - title_matches.rs: Already migrated in Phase 7.1 (uses NewOrgNode)
   - save_buffer.rs: Already migrated in Phase 7.2/7.3 (populates new_orgnode)
   - single_root_view.rs: No changes needed (doesn't use OrgNode directly)

   Merge:
   - validate_merge.rs: No changes needed (works with Tree<OrgNode> for validation)
   - mergeInstructionTriple.rs: No changes needed (works with Tree<OrgNode>)

   The merge code validates and generates instructions from the original
   Tree<OrgNode> forest, which is independent of PairTree. Will be updated
   in Phase 7.8 when old types are removed.

   All tests pass (207 tests)

** DONE 7.7 Migrate test utilities and error types
   Files: server/test_utils.rs, server/types/errors.rs

   Partially done or not needed with dual-field approach:

   test_utils.rs:
   - orgnode_forest_to_paired: Already updated in Phase 7.2 (populates new_orgnode)
   - compare_orgnode_forests, compare_two_forests_modulo_id: Work with Tree<OrgNode>
     for testing parsing - no changes needed
   - compare_orgnode_portions_of_pairforest_and_orgnodeforest: Compares .orgnode field
     for compatibility testing - no changes needed

   errors.rs:
   - BufferValidationError contains OrgNode for error context
   - Validation uses Tree<OrgNode> (old types)
   - Will change to NewOrgNode in Phase 7.8 when old types are removed

   All tests pass (207 tests)

** DONE 7.8 Sync new_orgnode after all orgnode mutations
   Files: Multiple files with write_at_node_in_tree calls

   7.8.1 DONE Migrate rendering to use NewOrgNode
   - orgnode_forest_to_string now uses new_orgnode_to_text()
   - Converts orgnode → NewOrgNode at render time (to capture mutations)
   - Checks ForestRoot using OrgNodeKind::Scaff(ScaffoldKind::ForestRoot)
   - Updated unit tests to use canonical scaffold titles
   - All 207 tests pass

   7.8.2 DONE Sync new_orgnode after all orgnode mutations
   - to_org/util.rs: makeIndefinitiveAndClobber, mark_if_visited_or_repeat_or_cycle,
     detect_and_mark_cycle (3 sites)
   - to_org/complete/contents.rs: clobberIndefinitiveOrgnode, ensure_source (2 sites)
   - to_org/complete/aliascol.rs: focus mutations (2 sites)
   - to_org/expand/definitive.rs: execute_definitive_view_request,
     indefinitize_content_subtree (2 sites already had sync in rebuild_pair_from_disk)
   - All 207 unit tests + 10 integration tests pass

   NOTE: Old types (OrgNode, Interp) are still used internally.
   The dual-field approach (NodePair with both orgnode and new_orgnode)
   is working. Full migration of parsing to produce NewOrgNode directly
   would be a future enhancement if desired.

** DONE 7.9-7.10 Cleanup
   7.9 Dead code removal:
   - Removed unused functions from to_org/util.rs:
     - is_forest_root, orgnode_from_title_and_rel, get_pid_from_pair_using_noderef
   - Removed NewPairTree utilities (new_forest_root_pair, new_new_forest, is_new_forest_root)
   - Added #[allow(dead_code)] for intentionally kept methods:
     - find_links_to in dbs/typedb/search.rs
     - ID::as_str, SourceNickname::new/as_str in types/misc.rs
   - Updated integration test (aliases-view-request) for canonical scaffold titles
   - No compiler warnings

   7.10 Type renames NOT done (deferred):
   - NewOrgNode, NewNodePair, NewPairTree, new_orgnode_to_text, etc.
     remain with their current names
   - from_old_orgnode and to_old_orgnode are still needed for conversion
   - The dual-field approach is stable and working
   - Full rename would require migrating parsing to produce NewOrgNode directly

   CURRENT STATE:
   - NodePair has: { orgnode: OrgNode, new_orgnode: Option<NewOrgNode> }
   - Tree construction populates both fields
   - Mutations sync new_orgnode after modifying orgnode
   - Rendering converts orgnode → NewOrgNode at render time
   - All 207 unit tests + 10 integration tests pass
   - No compiler warnings

** Decision on 7.3: Use the safer incremental approach
   DECISION: Use the safer approach with dual fields.

   Instead of changing NodePair.orgnode all at once:
   1. Add new field: NodePair { orgnode: OrgNode, new_orgnode: Option<NewOrgNode> }
   2. Migrate callers one by one to use new_orgnode
   3. When all callers use new_orgnode, remove orgnode field
   4. Rename new_orgnode -> orgnode (now it's NewOrgNode type)

   This is slower but much safer - each caller migration is a small,
   testable change. If something breaks, it's easy to identify which
   caller caused the issue.

* DONE Phase 8: Complete type migration
  Goal: Remove orgnode field from NodePair, use only new_orgnode.
  All steps completed per git commits e012824, 413753e, 0ee5568.

** DONE 8.1 Add helper methods to NewOrgNode
   Query methods:
   - id() -> Option<&ID>
   - title() -> &str
   - matches_interp(&Interp) -> bool (bridge for transition)
   - has_effect(EffectOnParent) -> bool
   - is_scaffold(&ScaffoldKind) -> bool
   - is_true_node() -> bool
   - is_scaffold_any() -> bool
   - scaffold_kind() -> Option<&ScaffoldKind>
   - is_indefinitive() -> bool
   - has_source() -> bool

   Mutation methods:
   - set_indefinitive(bool)
   - clear_body()
   - set_title(String)
   - set_source(String)
   - set_cycle(bool)
   - view_requests_mut() -> Option<&mut HashSet<ViewRequest>>

** DONE 8.2 Add helper methods to NodePair
   - orgnode_new() -> &NewOrgNode (panics if None)
   - orgnode_new_mut() -> &mut NewOrgNode

** DONE 8.3 Migrate reads from .orgnode to .orgnode_new()
   Migrated sites:
   - types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs:34 - unique_child_with_interp
   - to_org/util.rs:220 - is_ancestor_id
   - to_org/util.rs:234 - get_pid_in_pairtree
   - to_org/complete/sharing.rs:92 - Subscribee check
   - to_org/complete/contents.rs:78 - interp checks

** DONE 8.4 Migrate mutations to use new_orgnode directly
   Previously: code mutated .orgnode then synced to .new_orgnode
   Now: code reads/mutates .new_orgnode directly using helper methods

   Migrated all runtime reads from .orgnode to .orgnode_new():
   - types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs: pid_for_subscribee_and_its_subscriber_grandparent,
     ancestor_skgnode_from_disk, collect_child_aliases_at_nodepair_aliascol
   - to_org/expand/backpath.rs: find_child_by_id, find_children_by_ids
   - to_org/util.rs: collect_ids_from_pair_tree
   - to_org/complete/contents.rs: content child ID lookup, categorize_children_by_treatment
   - to_org/complete/aliascol.rs: validation
   - to_org/expand/definitive.rs: rebuild_pair_from_disk_mostly_clobbering_the_org

   Added new helper method to NewOrgNode:
   - interp() -> Interp (returns equivalent Interp for this node)

   Remaining .orgnode uses are:
   - Type definitions (NodePair struct)
   - NodePair construction (both fields set in sync)
   - Conversion functions
   - Test utility comparing against Tree<OrgNode>
   - Input parsing in from_text/ (operates on Tree<OrgNode>)

** DONE 8.5 Remove orgnode field from NodePair
   Changed NodePair to only have: { mskgnode, new_orgnode }
   - Removed orgnode field from NodePair struct
   - Made new_orgnode non-optional
   - Updated orgnode_new() and orgnode_new_mut() to access directly
   - Removed NewNodePair (now just a type alias)
   - Removed node_pair_to_new() and node_pair_from_new()
   - Updated all NodePair constructions (~12 locations)
   - Updated test utilities to use to_old_orgnode() for comparison
   - Updated test files to use orgnode_new() accessors

** DONE 8.6 Eliminate OrgNode construction outside parsing
   Goal: Stop constructing old OrgNode except in parsing and conversion functions.

   DONE: Changed skgnode_and_orgnode_from_* to return NewOrgNode directly:
   - to_org/util.rs: skgnode_and_orgnode_from_id, skgnode_and_orgnode_from_pid_and_source
   - Added neworgnode_content_from_disk() constructor

   DONE: Updated all callers to use NewOrgNode directly:
   - to_org/complete/contents.rs: extend_content
   - to_org/util.rs: make_and_append_child_pair, build_node_branch_minus_content
   - types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs: append_indefinitive_node
   - to_org/expand/backpath.rs: prepend_indefinitive_child_with_parent_ignores
   - to_org/expand/definitive.rs: rebuild_pair_from_disk_mostly_clobbering_the_org

   DONE: Added new constructors to orgnode_new.rs:
   - neworgnode_content_from_disk(id, source, title, body)
   - neworgnode_indefinitive_from_disk(id, source, title, effect)
   - neworgnode_with_metadata(id, source, title, body, effect, indef, edit_req, view_reqs)
   - neworgnode_scaffold_from_interp(interp, title)
   - effect_on_parent_from_interp(interp)

   DONE: Updated forest_root_pair() to use forest_root_new_orgnode() directly

   DONE: Updated insert_sourceless_node() to use neworgnode_scaffold_from_interp()

   DONE: Removed unused Tree<OrgNode> helper functions:
   - unique_orgnode_child_with_interp
   - unique_orgnode_child_with_interp_from_ref
   - collect_grandchild_aliases_for_orgnode

   All 35 unit tests + 10 integration tests pass.

   REMAINING OrgNode construction:
   - Parsing (parse_metadata_sexp.rs, uninterpreted.rs) still produces old types
   - Conversion functions (from_old_orgnode, to_old_orgnode) still needed
   - Tests in org_to_text.rs construct OrgNode for compatibility checks

** DONE 8.7 Rename types to final names
   Completed: git commit 413753e
   - NewOrgNode → OrgNode
   - new_orgnode → orgnode
   - new_orgnode_to_text → orgnode_to_text
   - orgnode_new() → orgnode()

** DONE 8.8 Remove LegacyOrgNode and conversion functions
   Completed: git commit e012824
   Removed the old OrgNode type (renamed to LegacyOrgNode during transition).

   NOTE: This was a partial cleanup. The following still remain:
   - Interp enum (still used in 13 files)
   - OrgnodeMetadata, OrgnodeCode (used by parsing)
   - Bridge functions: matches_interp(), interp(), from_parsed()
   See Phases 9-13 below for remaining cleanup.
