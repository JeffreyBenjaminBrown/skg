#+title: Incremental Plan for OrgNode Type Refactor

* Goal
  Split OrgNode into TrueNode | Scaffold to make invalid states unrepresentable.
  See spec-questions.org for the target type hierarchy.

* Guiding principles
  - Tests pass after every step
  - Introduce new types alongside old, then migrate, then remove old
  - Small commits with clear descriptions
  - When in doubt, add a conversion function rather than change everything at once

* DONE Phase 1: Define new types (no behavioral changes)
  Commit: 506a083
** 1.1 Create server/types/orgnode_new.rs with new type definitions
   - EffectOnParent enum: Content, Subscribee, ParentIgnores
   - ScaffoldKind enum: Alias(String), AliasCol, ForestRoot,
     HiddenInSubscribeeCol, HiddenOutsideOfSubscribeeCol, SubscribeeCol
   - Scaffold struct: kind: ScaffoldKind (no other fields needed)
   - TrueNode struct: title, body, id (Option), source (Option),
     effect_on_parent, indefinitive, view_data, edit_request, view_requests
   - OrgNodeKind enum: True(TrueNode), Scaff(Scaffold)
   - NewOrgNode struct: focused, folded, kind: OrgNodeKind
   - Add title_from_scaffold_kind() function with the fixed strings
   - Add derives: Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Serialize, Deserialize as needed
** 1.2 Add conversion functions in orgnode_new.rs
   - from_old_orgnode(OrgNode) -> NewOrgNode
   - to_old_orgnode(NewOrgNode) -> OrgNode
   - These should be lossless round-trips for valid OrgNodes
** 1.3 Add unit tests for the conversion functions
   - Test each Interp variant maps correctly
   - Test round-trip: old -> new -> old == old
   - Test round-trip: new -> old -> new == new
** 1.4 Export new types from server/types/orgnode.rs
   - pub mod orgnode_new; pub use orgnode_new::*;
   - Or inline the new types in orgnode.rs if cleaner
** Decision: Keep HiddenFromSubscribees separate from ParentIgnores
   During implementation, discovered that merging these in EffectOnParent
   would break lossless round-trips (they serialize to different sexp strings).
   DECISION: Keep both as separate EffectOnParent variants during transition.
   Can merge in Phase 7 if desired.

* DONE Phase 2: Migrate rendering (output path)
  Rendering is easier because it only reads OrgNodes, doesn't create them.
** 2.1 Update org_to_text.rs to work with NewOrgNode
   - Added new_orgnode_to_text() that takes &NewOrgNode
   - Added new_orgnodemd_to_string() for metadata rendering
   - Added scaffold_metadata_to_string() and true_node_metadata_to_string()
** 2.2 Update orgnodemd_to_string for new structure
   - New rendering handles TrueNode vs Scaffold differently
   - Scaffolds have minimal metadata (just interp, focused/folded)
   - TrueNodes have full metadata (id, source, view_data, code)
** 2.3 Run tests, fix any rendering issues
   - Added 15 rendering tests comparing old vs new output
   - All tests pass: old→new conversion produces identical rendering
** Decision: Scaffold titles use empty string during transition
   ScaffoldKind::title() returns descriptive strings ("its aliases", etc.)
   but the OLD OrgNode format uses empty strings for scaffold titles.
   For lossless round-trips, new rendering must match old behavior.
   DECISION: Use empty string for scaffold titles when rendering during transition.
   The descriptive titles will be enabled in Phase 7+ when we remove old types.

* DONE Phase 3: Migrate tree construction (output path continued)
  These functions build OrgNode trees from disk/TypeDB data.
** Decision: Use parallel NewNodePair type instead of changing NodePair
   Changing NodePair.orgnode from OrgNode to NewOrgNode would cascade to 11 files.
   DECISION: Add NewNodePair and NewPairTree as parallel types.
   - Keep old NodePair/PairTree unchanged
   - Add conversion functions between old and new types
   - Old code keeps working, new code can convert at boundaries
   - Merge types in Phase 7 when old types are removed
** Implemented approach (simpler than originally planned)
   The parallel types approach means we DON'T need to update all the tree
   construction files (3.2-3.8 below). Instead:
   - Added NewNodePair, NewPairTree types to server/types/tree.rs
   - Added node_pair_to_new() and node_pair_from_new() conversion functions
   - Added new_forest_root_pair() helper to server/to_org/util.rs
   - Added comprehensive tests for NodePair <-> NewNodePair round-trips
   The existing tree construction code continues to use PairTree.
   When new types are needed (e.g., for rendering), convert at the boundary.
** 3.1 Update server/types/tree.rs
   - Added NewNodePair struct with new_orgnode: NewOrgNode
   - Added NewPairTree type alias
   - Added NewNodePair::from_orgnode() and from_pair() constructors
   - Added node_pair_to_new() and node_pair_from_new() conversion functions
   - Added 7 tests for round-trip conversions
** 3.2 Update to_org/util.rs
   - Added new_forest_root_pair() returning NewNodePair
   - Added new_new_forest() (unused for now but available)
   - Added is_new_forest_root() (unused for now but available)
** 3.3-3.8 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating aliases.rs, sharing.rs, contents.rs,
   aliascol.rs, backpath.rs, definitive.rs, initial_bfs.rs.
   With parallel types + conversion at boundaries, these don't need changes yet.
   They will be updated in Phase 7 when we merge old and new types.
** 3.9 All tests pass
   - cargo test: 57 tests pass
   - integration tests: 10 tests pass

* DONE Phase 4: Migrate parsing (input path)
  Parsing is trickier because it builds OrgNodes from user text.
** Decision: Keep parsing using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach, parsing doesn't need changes:
   - Parsing produces Tree<OrgNode> (old types)
   - Validation works on old types
   - Conversion to new types happens at boundaries when needed
   - from_old_orgnode() converts OrgNode -> NewOrgNode
   The parsing code will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 4.1-4.4 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating parse_metadata_sexp.rs, uninterpreted.rs,
   add_missing_info.rs, and validate_tree.rs to produce new types.
   With conversion at boundaries, these files don't need changes yet.
** 4.5 All tests still pass
   - cargo test: 57 tests pass
   - integration tests: 10 tests pass

* DONE Phase 5: Migrate save instructions (input path continued)
** Decision: Keep save instructions using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach, save instruction code doesn't need changes:
   - Code works with Tree<OrgNode> and produces save instructions
   - Only TrueNodes generate save instructions (this logic stays the same)
   - No conversion to new types needed for save operations
   Code will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 5.1-5.3 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
   Original plan called for updating to_naive_instructions.rs,
   reconcile_same_id_instructions.rs, and validate_foreign_nodes.rs.
   With conversion at boundaries, these files don't need changes yet.
** 5.4 All tests still pass

* DONE Phase 6: Migrate remaining code
** Decision: Keep remaining code using old types during transition
   With the parallel types approach:
   - merge/validate_merge.rs - works with old types
   - merge/mergeInstructionTriple.rs - works with old types
   - types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs - works with old types
   - serve/handlers/*.rs - works with old types
   - test_utils.rs - works with old types
   All these will be updated in Phase 7 when old types are removed.
** 6.1-6.5 NOT NEEDED with parallel types approach
** 6.6 All tests still pass

** Summary: Phases 3-6 simplified by parallel types approach
   The parallel types approach (Option B) deferred most migration work to Phase 7.
   What was done:
   - Phase 1: Created new types (TrueNode, Scaffold, NewOrgNode)
   - Phase 2: Added new rendering functions (new_orgnode_to_text, etc.)
   - Phase 3: Added NewNodePair, NewPairTree, conversion functions
   - Phase 4-6: No changes needed (conversion at boundaries)
   What remains:
   - Phase 7: Remove old types, rename NewOrgNode -> OrgNode
   - Phase 8: Optional improvements

* Phase 7: Cleanup (subdivided for incremental migration)
  Goal: Remove old types, rename NewOrgNode -> OrgNode.
  Strategy: Migrate subsystem by subsystem, keeping tests passing at each step.

  Files using Interp:: (18 files)
  Files using OrgNode (28 files)
  Files accessing .code.interp (9 files, 14 occurrences)

** DONE 7.1 Migrate rendering subsystem
   Files: server/org_to_text.rs, server/serve/handlers/title_matches.rs

   - org_to_text.rs already has new_orgnode_to_text() functions
   - Updated title_matches.rs to use NewOrgNode and new_orgnode_to_text()
   - This was the only external caller of orgnode_to_text()
   - Internal use in orgnode_forest_to_string() tied to PairTree (step 7.3)
   - All tests pass

** 7.2 Migrate tree construction subsystem
   Files: server/to_org/util.rs, server/to_org/complete/*.rs,
          server/to_org/expand/*.rs (7 files)

   NOTE: Do this AFTER 7.3, since tree construction needs to populate
   the new_orgnode field that 7.3 adds.

   - These files build OrgNode trees from disk/TypeDB
   - Update to populate both orgnode AND new_orgnode in NodePair
   - Test after each file

** DONE 7.3 Add dual field to NodePair (do this BEFORE 7.2)
   Files: server/types/tree.rs, server/types/tree/orgnode_skgnode.rs,
          and all files that construct NodePair

   ORDERING NOTE: This step is done before 7.2 because tree construction
   needs the new_orgnode field to exist before it can populate it.

   Using the safer incremental approach:
   - Added new field: NodePair { orgnode, new_orgnode: Option<NewOrgNode> }
   - Initially new_orgnode is None everywhere
   - Updated all NodePair constructions (12 locations in 8 files)
   - Tree construction (7.2) will populate it
   - Callers (7.4-7.7) will migrate to read from it
   - Finally (7.8) remove orgnode field
   - All tests pass

** 7.4 Migrate parsing subsystem
   Files: server/serve/parse_metadata_sexp.rs,
          server/from_text/buffer_to_orgnodes/*.rs (4 files)

   - parse_metadata_sexp.rs: Parse sexp to new structures
     (parse into OrgnodeMetadata, then convert, OR parse directly to new)
   - uninterpreted.rs: Build Tree<NewOrgNode> instead of Tree<OrgNode>
   - add_missing_info.rs: Work with NewOrgNode
   - validate_tree.rs: Update Interp:: matches to OrgNodeKind matches
   - Test after each file

** 7.5 Migrate save instructions subsystem
   Files: server/from_text/orgnodes_to_instructions/*.rs,
          server/from_text/validate_foreign_nodes.rs (3 files)

   - to_naive_instructions.rs: Accept Tree<NewOrgNode>
   - reconcile_same_id_instructions.rs: Work with NewOrgNode
   - Test after each file

** 7.6 Migrate handlers and merge
   Files: server/serve/handlers/*.rs, server/merge/*.rs (4 files)

   - title_matches.rs: Update Interp checks
   - save_buffer.rs: Should work with new tree types
   - validate_merge.rs: Update to NewOrgNode
   - mergeInstructionTriple.rs: Update if needed
   - Test after each file

** 7.7 Migrate test utilities and error types
   Files: server/test_utils.rs, server/types/errors.rs

   - test_utils.rs: Update test helpers to use new types
   - errors.rs: BufferValidationError contains OrgNode, update to NewOrgNode
   - Test all tests still pass

** 7.8 Remove old types
   Files: server/types/orgnode.rs, server/types/orgnode_new.rs

   Once nothing uses the old types:
   - Remove from orgnode.rs:
     - OrgNode struct
     - Interp enum (scaffold variants: ForestRoot, AliasCol, Alias, etc.)
     - OrgnodeCode struct
     - OrgnodeMetadata struct (or keep if still useful)
   - Keep in orgnode.rs (still needed):
     - OrgnodeViewData, OrgnodeRelationships
     - EditRequest, ViewRequest
   - Test that everything still compiles

** 7.9 Rename new types to final names
   Files: All files using New* types

   - NewOrgNode -> OrgNode
   - NewNodePair -> NodePair
   - NewPairTree -> PairTree
   - new_orgnode_to_text -> orgnode_to_text
   - new_forest_root_pair -> forest_root_pair
   - from_old_orgnode, to_old_orgnode -> DELETE (no longer needed)
   - Use IDE/sed for bulk rename, verify no breakage
   - Test thoroughly

** 7.10 Final cleanup
   - Remove conversion functions (from_old_orgnode, to_old_orgnode, etc.)
   - Remove #[allow(dead_code)] annotations added during transition
   - Review for dead code, unused imports
   - Run clippy
   - Final test pass: cargo test, integration tests
   - Consider squashing commits or keeping history

** Decision on 7.3: Use the safer incremental approach
   DECISION: Use the safer approach with dual fields.

   Instead of changing NodePair.orgnode all at once:
   1. Add new field: NodePair { orgnode: OrgNode, new_orgnode: Option<NewOrgNode> }
   2. Migrate callers one by one to use new_orgnode
   3. When all callers use new_orgnode, remove orgnode field
   4. Rename new_orgnode -> orgnode (now it's NewOrgNode type)

   This is slower but much safer - each caller migration is a small,
   testable change. If something breaks, it's easy to identify which
   caller caused the issue.

* Phase 8: Optional improvements (separate PRs)
** 8.1 Make TrueNode.id required (separate refactor as discussed)
** 8.2 Make TrueNode.source required (separate refactor)
** 8.3 Consider splitting TrueNode further by effect_on_parent

* Testing strategy
  - Run `cargo nextest run` after each numbered step
  - Run `bash/integration-tests.sh` after each phase
  - If tests fail, fix before proceeding
  - Commit after each passing step for easy bisection

* Estimated file changes by phase
  | Phase | Files touched |
  |-------+---------------|
  |     1 | 1-2           |
  |     2 | 2-3           |
  |     3 | 8-10          |
  |     4 | 4-5           |

  |     7 | 10-15         |
  Total: ~27 server files + tests

* tricky|dangerous parts

** Interp is used in match statements everywhere
   The current code has many `match interp { ... }` blocks.
   After the refactor, these become `match kind { True(t) => ..., Scaff(s) => ... }`.

   DANGER: It's easy to miss a match arm or handle a case incorrectly.

   MITIGATION: The compiler will catch missing arms if we remove Interp variants.
   But during the transition, both old and new types exist, so we lose this safety.

   SUGGESTION: Add #[deny(unreachable_patterns)] where possible.
   Consider adding a "bridge" function that maps old Interp to new kind,
   so there's one authoritative place for the mapping.

** OrgnodeMetadata is deeply nested
   Current: OrgNode.metadata.code.interp
   New: OrgNode.kind (TrueNode | Scaffold)

   DANGER: Many field accesses like `node.metadata.code.interp` need updating.
   Easy to miss some, especially in less-tested code paths.

   MITIGATION: Use grep/IDE to find all `.metadata.code.interp` accesses.
   The compiler will catch type errors, but semantic errors are possible.

*** TODO a
    Bear in mind that there might be lots of whitespace in that string, and it might even be spread across multiple lines. (Sorry, that's how I find the code easy to read.)

** focused/folded move from OrgnodeViewData to OrgNode
   Current: OrgNode.metadata.view_data.focused
   New: OrgNode.focused

   DANGER: These fields are accessed in many places.
   Some code might assume all OrgNodes have view_data (they do now).
   After refactor, Scaffolds don't have view_data, but DO have focused/folded.

   MITIGATION: Search for all `.view_data.focused` and `.view_data.folded`.
   Update to use the top-level fields.

** Scaffold validation becomes type-enforced but happens later
   Current: Validation checks "AliasCol should not have body".
   New: Scaffold type has no body field, so this is impossible.

   DANGER: The error must now occur during parsing, not validation.
   If parsing creates a Scaffold when there's body text, that text is silently lost.

   MITIGATION: Parser must error when scaffold-interp headline has body.
   Add explicit test: "parsing AliasCol with body produces error".

** PairTree (Tree<NodePair>) contains OrgNode
   NodePair has: orgnode: OrgNode, skgnode: Option<SkgNode>

   DANGER: Updating OrgNode affects NodePair, which affects PairTree.
   PairTree is used throughout the rendering pipeline.

   MITIGATION: NodePair is just a container; updating OrgNode type
   should propagate automatically. But watch for places that construct
   NodePair manually.

** title_from_scaffold_kind() must match current behavior
   The strings are scattered across the codebase.

   DANGER: If titleFromInterp returns different strings than current code,
   round-trip tests will fail, or worse, behavior changes silently.

   MITIGATION: I found the strings (see spec-questions.org).
   Add a test that the function returns exactly these strings.
   Compare against the actual code locations:
   - AliasCol: "" (but should become "It has these aliases.")
   - SubscribeeCol: "it subscribes to these"
   - HiddenOutsideOfSubscribeeCol: "hidden from all subscriptions"
   - HiddenInSubscribeeCol: "hidden from this subscription"
   - ForestRoot: ""
*** TODO a
    Now that I see what the others are, let's change the AliasCol title to match that style: just use "its aliases'.
** Conversion functions must be truly lossless
   from_old_orgnode() and to_old_orgnode() are used during transition.

   DANGER: If conversion loses information, bugs appear only when
   old and new code interact (hard to reproduce).

   MITIGATION: Exhaustive round-trip tests.
   Property test: for any valid OrgNode o, to_old(from_old(o)) == o.
   Property test: for any valid NewOrgNode n, from_old(to_old(n)) == n.

** Test coverage may not catch all edge cases
   Some code paths are only exercised by integration tests or manual testing.

   DANGER: A type change might break a rarely-used feature.

   MITIGATION: Run full integration test suite after each phase.
   Consider adding more unit tests for under-tested code before refactoring.

** TODO The "indefinitive" field has subtle semantics
   It means different things in different contexts:
   - Repeated node in view (don't recurse)
   - BFS limit reached (truncated)
   - User manually set indefinitive
   - Foreign node (can't edit)

   DANGER: Moving indef from OrgnodeCode to TrueNode might lose context.

   MITIGATION: The boolean just means "don't save changes to this node's children".
   The context is determined by tree position, not the flag itself.
   But review all places that SET indefinitive to ensure they still make sense.

*** a
    Actually, 'indefinitive' means 'changes to this node's children will not affect it'. Things you've listed as what it 'means' are not that, but rather ways it can arise. In all cases it has the same effect when saving.
** sexp serialization format must not change
   The metadata sexp (skg ...) is parsed by both Rust and Emacs.

   DANGER: If the new types serialize differently, Emacs breaks.

   MITIGATION: orgnodemd_to_string() must produce identical output.
   Add test: "new type serializes to same sexp as old type".
   The sexp format is the contract; internal types can change freely.
* TODO Before deviating from the plan, stop and report.
  This plan looks great. But when the rubber hits the road it's very likely you'll encounter something unanticipated. Before making any important unforeseen decisions, report the fork in the road to me.
