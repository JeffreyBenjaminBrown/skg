* Markdown to Org-roam Converter

Converts Markdown files to Org-roam format with ID-based links.

** Most likely needed usage

#+begin_src bash
python3 md-to-org-converter.py
#+end_src

But it can do other stuff -- see 'Files'.

** Files
*** md-to-org-converter.py   : Main converter script
**** purpose
Converts =README.md= and =docs/*.md= files to =.org= format with:

- Org-roam headers (=:PROPERTIES:= block with =:ID:=, =#+title:=)
- ID-based links (=[[id:uuid][text]]=) instead of file paths
- Standard org formatting (headings, code blocks, inline markup)
**** It's idempotent.

  The converter reuses existing UUIDs from =.org-id-db.json=. Running it twice on the same input produces identical output.

**** Output format

  #+begin_example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       846207ef-11d6-49e4-89b4-4558b2989a60
    :END:
    #+title: Document Title
    * Document Title
      Content...
    ** Section
    More content...
  #+end_example

**** how it works
***** It requires two passes.
  1. *Pass 1*: Scans all =.md= files, generates UUIDs, builds a mapping database
  2. *Pass 2*: Converts files, resolving =.md= links to =[[id:uuid]]= format
*** test-org-links.el        : validate org-roam links in some data
*** restructure-md-files.py  : Ensure each .md has single root heading
**** That heading matches its title.
**** why I need this
     A line like '#+title: music'
     does not render on GitHub,
     and I want these notes to be readable by others.
*** restructure-org-files.py : (Probably obsolete)
    If I want to be able to edit them easily,
    then the .org format I use has to be org-roam.
    This used another kind of link.
*** .org-id-db.json: UUID database
    This is not part of the code but the code will generate it here.
    It can be safely left in place; it's small and maybe speeds up the process.
**** TODO ? That smells unnecessary.
** Requirements

- Python 3
- Input: =.md= files with single =#= root heading
- The =restructure-md-files.py= script can fix multi-root files
