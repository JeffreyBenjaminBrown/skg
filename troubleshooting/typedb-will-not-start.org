* First: Check If TypeDB Is Already Running

Before trying to start TypeDB, always check if it's already running.

** Quick Status Check (Recommended)

Use this script for a comprehensive status check:

#+begin_src bash
bash troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-status.sh
#+end_src

This will show:
- Whether TypeDB process is running
- Recent log entries
- Whether startup was successful
- Helpful commands for your situation

** Manual Check

You can also check manually:

#+begin_src bash
ps aux | grep typedb | grep -v grep
#+end_src

**Important:** Use `ps aux` (not `ps -a`). The `x` flag is necessary because TypeDB runs without a controlling terminal (shown as `?` in the TTY column). The `-a` flag alone won't show background daemon processes.

If you see output like this, TypeDB is already running:
#+begin_example
ubuntu    276330 10.5  0.8 6410476 130144 ?      Sl   14:45   1:02 /opt/typedb/core/server/typedb_server_bin
                                                 ^
                                    Note: ? means no terminal (this is normal for daemons)
#+end_example

Other commands that work:
- `pgrep typedb` - simple process name search
- `ps -ef | grep typedb` - alternative format

** "Address already in use" Error

If you try to run `typedb server` and get this error:
#+begin_example
error creating server listener: Address already in use (os error 98)
Exited with error: [SRO11] Could not serve gRPC on 0.0.0.0:1729.
#+end_example

This means TypeDB is **already running**. This is not a problem - you don't need to start it again.

** What to do

- If TypeDB is already running and working: Nothing! You're good.
- If you want to restart it:
  1. Kill the existing process: `pkill -f typedb`
  2. Start it fresh: `nohup typedb server > /home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &`
- If it's running but not responding: Check the log file and see the sections below

* TypeDB Exits Immediately After "Ready!" Message
** Symptoms
- TypeDB log shows "Ready!" message indicating successful startup
- Process appears in `ps` output briefly but then disappears
- No error messages in the log file
- Log file ends cleanly with "Ready!" but process is not running
** Root Cause
This happens when TypeDB is backgrounded without redirecting stdin from /dev/null. The process receives EOF on stdin (either when the shell session ends or stdin closes) and exits gracefully. Since it's a clean exit after successful startup, no error is logged.
** Solution
Always redirect stdin from /dev/null when backgrounding TypeDB:
#+begin_src bash
nohup typedb server > /home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
#+end_src

The critical part is `< /dev/null` which disconnects stdin from the terminal.

** Verification
After starting TypeDB, wait a few seconds and verify it's still running:
#+begin_src bash
sleep 5 && ps aux | grep -v grep | grep typedb
#+end_src

You should see the typedb_server_bin process running.

** Note
This issue was fixed in `/home/ubuntu/bash/run-servers.sh` on 2025-10-14. If you're using that script, it should now work correctly. If you're manually starting TypeDB, remember to include the stdin redirection.

* Corrupted TypeDB Checkpoints
** PITFALL: Never delete the _system database.
** Quick Diagnostic Workflow
When TypeDB fails to start with "Connection refused" on port 1729, or when you want to prevent issues:

*** Scenario A: TypeDB is Running (Preventive Maintenance)
If TypeDB is currently running but you want to prevent future issues:

1. *Check database count* - Use diagnostic script while TypeDB is running:
   #+begin_src bash
   bash troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-databases.sh
   #+end_src

2. *If many test databases found* (e.g., 20+ databases):
   - Clean them up immediately to prevent "Too many open files" on next restart
   - Use manual cleanup (most reliable):
     #+begin_src bash
     cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*
     #+end_src
   - TypeDB will continue running normally after cleanup
   - No restart needed unless you encounter issues

*** Scenario B: TypeDB Won't Start
When TypeDB fails to start with "Connection refused" on port 1729:

1. *Check the TypeDB log first* - This is your most valuable diagnostic tool:
   #+begin_src bash
   tail -100 /home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log
   #+end_src
   Look for: "Too many open files", checkpoint recovery errors, RocksDB errors

2. *Count databases* using the diagnostic script:
   #+begin_src bash
   bash troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-databases.sh
   #+end_src
   This tells you if test database accumulation is the problem

3. *If many test databases found* (e.g., 20+ databases named skg-test*):
   This is almost certainly causing "Too many open files" errors at startup
   Proceed directly to cleanup (see Solution section below)

** The problem
*** Symptoms
- TypeDB server fails to start with "Connection refused" error when trying to connect to port 1729
- TypeDB log shows error about "Too many open files"
- Error pattern in `/home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log`:
  #+begin_example
  called Result::unwrap() on an Err value: Os { code: 24, kind: Uncategorized, message: "Too many open files" }
  #+end_example
- Or checkpoint recovery errors:
  #+begin_example
  [STO10] Failed to recover from checkpoint for database 'DATABASE_NAME'.
  Cause:
        [CLO7] Error while opening storage keyspaces.
  Cause:
        RocksDB { name: "OptimisedPrefix25", source: Error { message: "IO error: While opendir: PATH: Too many open files" } }
  #+end_example
- Or during test runs (Connection Error from Rust tests):
  #+begin_example
  Connection Error: Unable to connect to TypeDB server(s), received errors:
  - 127.0.0.1:1729:
  IO error: while open a file for lock: /opt/typedb/core/server/data/skg-test-DATABASE_NAME/storage/OptimisedPrefix16/LOCK: Too many open files
  #+end_example
- The "too many open files" error occurs because TypeDB attempts to open all databases at startup, including corrupted ones and accumulated test databases
- This error can also appear when tests try to create new databases while TypeDB already has many databases open
*** Root Cause
This typically happens when:
1. *Test database accumulation* (most common): Many test runs leave behind skg-test* databases
   - Each database uses file handles
   - TypeDB opens all databases at startup
   - System file handle limit is exceeded (error code 24)
   - VERIFIED FIX: Deleting 31 accumulated test databases resolved the issue completely
2. Docker container or system is stopped abruptly while TypeDB is running
3. TypeDB doesn't get a chance to properly close databases and flush checkpoints
4. RocksDB (TypeDB's storage engine) leaves databases in an inconsistent state

Other common corruption patterns:
- Error: "Corruption: Mismatch in unique ID on table file"
  - Cause: RocksDB MANIFEST file corruption from incomplete writes
  - Solution: Same as above - delete the corrupted database
- Error: "Could not open database" with "LoadErrorDirectoryMissing" for WAL directory
  #+begin_example
  [SRO6] Could not open database.
  Cause:
        [DBO5] Error opening WAL.
  Cause:
        WAL { source: LoadErrorDirectoryMissing { directory: "/.../wal" } }
  #+end_example
  - Cause: Database directory is incomplete or corrupted (missing WAL subdirectory)
  - Solution: Same as above - delete the corrupted database (usually a test database)
** Solution:
*** Recommended Approach: Use Diagnostic Script First
The most reliable way to fix this issue:

1. *Diagnose* - Check what databases exist and identify test databases:
   #+begin_src bash
   bash troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-databases.sh
   #+end_src
   This script:
   - Shows count of test databases (these can be safely deleted)
   - Identifies potentially corrupt databases
   - Gives you confidence about what to remove
   - VERIFIED: Successfully identified 31 test databases causing the problem

2. *Clean up test databases* - Use manual cleanup (most reliable):
   #+begin_src bash
   cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*
   #+end_src
   - The cleanup script may have issues with symlinked directories
   - Manual cleanup is the most reliable approach
   - VERIFIED: Successfully resolved "Too many open files" issue

   Alternative: Use the cleanup script (may require adjustments):
   #+begin_src bash
   bash troubleshooting/typedb/clean-typedb-test-databases.sh
   #+end_src
   - Interactive confirmation before deletion
   - Note: Script uses /opt/typedb/core/server/data which is symlinked to /var/lib/typedb/core/data
   - If script doesn't find databases, use manual cleanup above instead

3. *Restart TypeDB*:
   #+begin_src bash
   pkill -f typedb
   nohup typedb server > /home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log 2>&1 < /dev/null &
   #+end_src

4. *Verify* - Check that TypeDB started successfully:
   #+begin_src bash
   tail -20 /home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log
   #+end_src
   Look for "TypeDB Server is ready" message

*** Alternative: Manual Cleanup (if scripts unavailable)
**** For test database accumulation:
This deletes test databases. Note: Some test databases are named "skg-test"
without a dash before "test", so we need to match both patterns.
#+begin_src bash
cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*
#+end_src

Or using the symlinked path (equivalent):
#+begin_src bash
rm -rf /opt/typedb/core/server/data/skg-test*
#+end_src

Or using find (more portable but slower):
#+begin_src bash
find /var/lib/typedb/core/data/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name "skg-test*" -exec rm -rf {} \;
#+end_src

**** For specific corrupted database:
1. Identify the problematic database from the error message in the log
2. Remove the corrupted database directory:
   #+begin_src bash
   rm -rf /opt/typedb/core/server/data/PROBLEMATIC_DATABASE_NAME
   #+end_src

*** Script Reference
**** troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-databases.sh
- Classifies all TypeDB databases as 'okay', 'corrupt', or 'test'
- Identifies corruption indicators like inaccessible storage directories
- Provides summary and recommendations
- Very helpful for understanding the scope of the problem before taking action
**** troubleshooting/typedb/clean-typedb-test-databases.sh
- Safely removes all test databases (pattern: *skg-*test*)
- Interactive confirmation before deletion
- Preserves system and production databases
** Diagnostic Lessons Learned
*** What Was Helpful (Do This First)
1. *Reading the TypeDB log* - `/home/ubuntu/logs/typedb.log` was the most valuable source
   - Showed the exact error: "Too many open files" with OS error code 24
   - Provided immediate direction for investigation
   - Start here every time TypeDB won't start

2. *Using check-typedb-databases.sh* - Confirmed the diagnosis
   - Showed exactly how many test databases had accumulated (31 to 56 in documented cases)
   - Gave confidence that test database cleanup was the right solution
   - Quick to run and informative
   - Can be run even when TypeDB is running (for preventive maintenance)

3. *Following the documented solution* - The existing documentation was accurate
   - Manual cleanup with `rm -rf /opt/typedb/core/server/data/skg-test*` worked perfectly
   - All integration tests passed after cleanup

*** What Could Be Misleading
1. *"Connection refused" error alone* - This is too generic
   - Could be many things: server not running, wrong port, firewall, etc.
   - Don't spend time checking ports or network - check the log first
   - The log will tell you why the server failed to start

2. *Checking if process is running* - Less helpful than expected
   - Process might be running but failing to initialize
   - Process might exit immediately on startup
   - Again, the log is more informative

3. *Looking at individual database directories* - Not necessary
   - The check-typedb-databases.sh script does this better
   - Manual inspection is time-consuming and error-prone
   - Use the script instead

*** Prevention
To avoid accumulating test databases in the future:

1. *Regular cleanup* - Add to periodic maintenance (before TypeDB restarts):
   #+begin_src bash
   cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*
   #+end_src
   - Safe to run even while TypeDB is running
   - Prevents "Too many open files" errors on next restart

2. *After test runs* - Clean up test databases when done testing:
   #+begin_src bash
   cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*
   #+end_src

3. *Monitor database count* - Check occasionally (especially before restarts):
   #+begin_src bash
   bash troubleshooting/typedb/check-typedb-databases.sh
   #+end_src
   - Alert threshold: 20+ test databases is risky
   - Documented cases: 20, 31, 56 test databases caused issues

4. Consider adding test database cleanup to test teardown procedures

Note: Manual cleanup using `cd /var/lib/typedb/core/data && rm -rf skg-test*`
is more reliable than the cleanup script, especially with symlinked directories.
